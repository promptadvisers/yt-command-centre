# Claude Code Skills Import

Skip the extraction process entirely. Import Anthropic's official production-ready skills directly into Claude Code with one command.

---

## The Command

Clone https://github.com/anthropics/skills.git and copy the skills/*/ directories into .claude/skills/, keeping each as a separate named folder

## Step-by-Step

1. Open your terminal
2. Navigate to your project folder
3. Run the command above (or paste it into Claude Code and let it handle it)
4. The skills are now available in your `.claude/skills/` directory

## What You Get

Anthropic's official skills include pre-built capabilities for:
- Excel/spreadsheet manipulation (xlsx)
- PowerPoint/presentation creation (pptx)
- Word document generation (docx)
- PDF processing and creation
- And more...

These are the same skills Claude Code uses internally—now available for your projects.

## Works For Everyone

- **Technical users**: Run the git clone yourself
- **Non-technical users**: Just paste this command into Claude Code and it will do everything for you
