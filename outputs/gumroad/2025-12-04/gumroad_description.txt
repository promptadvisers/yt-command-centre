What You Get

The Extraction Super Prompt: A comprehensive prompt template that reverse-engineers ANY document Claude creates (Excel, PowerPoint, Word, PDF) - extracting structure, formulas, styling, and step-by-step recreation instructions.

The Packaging Prompt: A follow-up prompt that bundles everything into a neat Markdown + ZIP care package for easy copy-paste recreation elsewhere.

One-Line Skills Import Command: Skip the extraction entirely - directly import Anthropic's official Claude Code skills with a single terminal command. Works for technical AND non-technical users.

Complete 3-Step Workflow: Whether you want to reverse-engineer Claude's work or fast-track with native skills, you get both paths covered.

If you want video walkthroughs of advanced Claude Code techniques plus exclusive prompts and workflows, join the Early AI-dopters Community (https://www.skool.com/earlyaidopters/about) - you won't regret it 😉
