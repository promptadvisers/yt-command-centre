# Claude Code Document Skills - Video Hooks

## Hook 1: The "Office Worker Replacement" Hook

Most people are still treating AI like a fancy autocomplete.

Meanwhile, I'm using Claude Code to build entire PowerPoints, Excel models with working formulas, Word documents, and even branded PDFs - all from a single natural language command.

No templates. No copy-pasting. No switching between 5 different apps.

While everyone else is manually formatting slides and wrestling with Excel functions, Claude Code is doing the heavy lifting for me in seconds.

Whether you're technical or not, this video is going to show you the easy way AND the more hands-on approach to building real business documents with AI.

And as a bonus, I'll show you a trick to scrape any website's branding and apply it to your documents automatically.

Let's get into it.

## Hook 2: The "Unfair Advantage" Hook

There's a reason the people who know about this aren't talking about it.

Claude Code has a set of skills that can generate professional PowerPoints, Excel spreadsheets with actual formulas, Word docs, and even fillable PDFs.

And almost nobody understands how powerful this actually is.

I'm not talking about generating a basic outline and then manually building everything yourself.

I'm talking about going from a vague idea to a polished, professional document ready to send to clients - in minutes.

In this video, I'll show you how to do this whether you're comfortable with code or you've never opened a terminal in your life.

Plus, I'll show you an Easter egg: how to scrape a company's website branding and apply it to any document you create.

This is the future of productivity, and it's already here.

## Hook 3: The "Everyone's Doing It Wrong" Hook

You're probably still building documents the hard way.

Open PowerPoint. Create slides. Format everything manually. Export. Start over in Excel. Copy-paste numbers. Hope the formulas don't break.

There's a reason this process hasn't changed in 20 years - until now.

Claude Code has document skills that can create entire presentations, Excel models with complex formulas, Word documents, and PDFs - all in one place, all from natural language.

No switching apps. No manual formatting. No broken formulas.

In this video, I'm going to show you exactly how this works - the easy way for beginners and the power-user way for those who want more control.

And I'll throw in a secret: how to clone any website's branding and apply it to your documents - even match the style of publications like The Economist.

This is the document workflow of the future.

## Hook 4: The "Cheat Code Nobody Uses" Hook

There's a cheat code hiding inside Claude Code that turns it into a one-stop document factory.

I'm talking about generating PowerPoint decks, Excel spreadsheets with working formulas, Word documents, and PDFs - all from a single prompt.

While everyone else is asking ChatGPT to "help write a presentation outline" and then spending hours building it manually...

You could be generating the entire finished product in minutes.

And it gets better. I'll show you how to take any company's website, scrape their branding, and automatically apply it to your documents. Then recreate that document in the style of The Economist.

This is the kind of workflow that used to require a team of designers and analysts.

Now it's just you and Claude Code.

Let me show you exactly how to set this up.

## Hook 5: The "10X Productivity" Hook

What if I told you that you could build a PowerPoint, an Excel model, a Word doc, and a PDF - all from one conversation?

Most people don't realize Claude Code has built-in skills specifically designed for document generation.

We're talking about presentations with proper layouts, spreadsheets with actual formulas that work, Word documents with professional formatting, and PDFs you can fill and edit.

And you don't need to be a developer to use this.

In this video, I'm going to walk you through both the easy path and the more technical path - so whether you're technical or not, you'll be able to use this immediately.

Plus, I'll show you a hidden gem: how to scrape a website's branding and apply it to everything you create. Even match the editorial style of major publications like The Economist.

If you've been looking for a way to 10X your document workflow, this is it.
