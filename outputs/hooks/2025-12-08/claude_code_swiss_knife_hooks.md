# Video Hooks: Claude Code Swiss Army Knife

**Video Concept:** Claude Code as a versatile "Swiss Army knife" for building middleware apps - replacing 5 single-purpose apps with one tool.

**5 Demos:** Video splitting, image conversion, PDF merging, audio extraction, AI image editing with Gemini API

## HOOK 1: The Subscription Audit (Contrarian + Pain Point)

I just canceled $47/month in app subscriptions - and I'm getting MORE done than before.

Here's what I was paying for: Zamzar for converting images. CloudConvert for video files. SmallPDF for merging documents. Some random tool for extracting audio.

All of them doing ONE thing each. All of them charging monthly.

Then I realized: Claude Code can do ALL of this. And I'm going to prove it to you right now with 5 demos back to back.

Let's dive in.

## HOOK 2: The Challenge (Proof + High Stakes)

"Claude Code can build ANYTHING."

Bold claim, right? I'm going to prove it in the next 15 minutes.

I have 5 challenges lined up - video splitting, image conversion, PDF merging, audio extraction, and AI image editing. Five completely different tasks that normally require five different apps.

One tool. Five challenges. Let's see if Claude Code can handle them all.

## HOOK 3: The Realization (Personal Story + Pattern Interrupt)

I was about to pay $12 for an app to split a video file in half.

Then I stopped and thought: wait, I have Claude Code open right here. Let me just... ask it.

45 seconds later, my video was split.

That moment changed how I think about Claude Code entirely. It's not just for coding - it's a Swiss Army knife for literally any file operation you can think of.

Let me show you what I mean.

## HOOK 4: The One-Liner Reveal (Extreme Efficiency)

One line. That's all it takes.

"Split this video in half." Done.
"Convert these PNGs to JPEGs." Done.
"Merge these PDFs." Done.
"Extract the audio from this MP4." Done.

Claude Code just replaced 5 apps I was paying for - with one-line commands.

I'm going to walk you through all 5 of these right now, and by the end, you'll never pay for a file conversion tool again.

## HOOK 5: The Discovery (Insider Secret)

Most people use Claude Code for coding.

That's like using a Swiss Army knife just for the blade - and ignoring the scissors, the screwdriver, the bottle opener, and everything else.

I've discovered that Claude Code quietly handles tasks that people are paying MONTHLY subscriptions for - video processing, image conversion, PDF manipulation, audio extraction... even AI image editing.

Let me show you what 90% of users are missing.

## HOOK 6: The "Stop Using These Apps" (Contrarian)

Stop paying for these apps:
- CloudConvert
- Zamzar
- SmallPDF
- Any file conversion service

You have Claude Code. You don't need them anymore.

I'm not exaggerating. In the next 15 minutes, I'll show you 5 real tasks I used to pay for - now done instantly with Claude Code.
