# Long-Form Hooks: Claude Code Swiss Army Knife

**Video Concept:** Claude Code as a versatile "Swiss Army knife" for building middleware apps - replacing 5 single-purpose apps with one tool.

**5 Demos:** Video splitting, image conversion, PDF merging, audio extraction, AI image editing with Gemini API

## HOOK 1: The Subscription Audit (Contrarian + Pain Point)

I just canceled $47 a month in app subscriptions.

And here's the thing - I'm actually getting MORE done than I was before.

Let me show you what I was paying for. Zamzar - that's $9 a month - for converting images between formats. CloudConvert - another $12 - for handling video files. SmallPDF - $15 - just for merging and splitting documents. And then some random tool I found on Product Hunt for extracting audio from videos - that was $11.

Four apps. Four monthly subscriptions. Four different logins. Four different interfaces to learn.

And every single one of them does ONE thing.

Then last week, I had a video file I needed to split in half. I was about to open CloudConvert, and I stopped. I had Claude Code open in another window. And I thought... let me just ask it.

"Split this video file in half."

Forty-five seconds later - done.

That's when it hit me. Claude Code isn't just for coding. It's a Swiss Army knife for literally ANY file operation you can think of.

So I tested it. Five different tasks. Five things I was paying monthly subscriptions for.

And I'm going to show you all five of them right now, because by the end of this video, you're going to cancel some subscriptions too.

Let's dive in.

## HOOK 2: The Challenge (Proof + High Stakes)

"Claude Code can build ANYTHING."

That's a bold claim, right? Sounds like marketing hype. Sounds like something someone says when they're trying to sell you a course.

So let's put it to the test. Right now. On camera.

I have five challenges lined up. Five completely different tasks. Tasks that normally require five completely different applications, each with their own learning curve, their own subscription fee, their own limitations.

Challenge one: Split a video file in half. Challenge two: Convert a batch of PNG images to JPEG. Challenge three: Merge multiple PDFs into one document. Challenge four: Extract the audio track from an MP4 video. And challenge five - this is the interesting one - use AI to edit an image, specifically changing the background using the Gemini API.

Five challenges. One tool. No cheating, no pre-written scripts, no preparation.

If Claude Code can handle all five of these - and I mean handle them well, not just technically complete them - then I think we can safely say it earns that "Swiss Army knife" title.

And if it can't? Well, at least we'll know its limits.

Let's find out.

## HOOK 3: The Realization (Personal Story + Pattern Interrupt)

I was about to spend $12 on an app to split a video file in half.

Twelve dollars. For something I needed to do once. Just cut a 40-minute video into two 20-minute parts so I could upload them separately.

I had my credit card out. I was on the checkout page. And then I looked over at my other monitor, and Claude Code was just sitting there. Open. Waiting.

And I thought... you know what, let me just ask.

I typed: "Split this video file in half."

I didn't expect much. I figured it would tell me to download ffmpeg, or give me some complicated terminal command, or say it couldn't do it.

Instead, it just... did it.

Forty-five seconds. Two files. Done.

I sat there for a minute just staring at my screen. Because I realized I'd been thinking about Claude Code completely wrong.

I'd been treating it like a coding assistant. Something you use when you're building software. Something for developers.

But that's like buying a Swiss Army knife and only using the main blade. You're ignoring the scissors, the screwdriver, the can opener, the bottle opener - all these other tools that are right there, ready to use.

Claude Code can handle video. It can handle images. PDFs. Audio files. It can even tap into AI APIs to do things like edit images or generate content.

And I'm going to prove it to you right now with five demos - five things I used to pay monthly subscriptions for, all done with simple one-line commands.

This changed how I think about the tool entirely. And by the end of this video, I think it'll change how you think about it too.

Let's dive in.

## HOOK 4: The One-Liner Reveal (Extreme Efficiency)

One line.

That's all it takes.

"Split this video in half." Done. Forty-five seconds.

"Convert these PNGs to JPEGs." Done. About a minute for a batch of twenty.

"Merge these five PDFs into one." Done. Instant.

"Extract the audio from this MP4." Done. Saves as an MP3, perfect quality.

"Change the background of this image to a beach." Done. Uses the Gemini API, handles the whole thing automatically.

Five tasks. Five one-line commands. Zero subscriptions. Zero new apps to learn. Zero uploading files to sketchy websites and hoping they don't steal your data.

I used to pay for apps that did each of these things individually. Zamzar for format conversion. CloudConvert for video processing. SmallPDF for document handling. Random tools for audio extraction.

Every single one of them: replaced.

By a tool I already had open. A tool I was already paying for. A tool that, honestly, I was severely underutilizing.

Claude Code isn't just for coding. It's for everything. And I'm going to walk you through all five of these use cases right now, step by step, so you can start using it the same way.

By the end of this video, you're going to look at your app subscriptions very differently.

Let's get into it.

## HOOK 5: The Discovery (Insider Secret)

Here's something most people don't realize about Claude Code.

They use it for coding. They open it up when they need to write a function, debug an error, or build a feature. And that's great - it's excellent at that.

But that's like owning a Swiss Army knife and only ever using the main blade.

You're ignoring the scissors. The screwdriver. The bottle opener. The saw. The tweezers. All these other tools that are built right in, ready to use, that you're just... not touching.

Claude Code can process video files. It can convert images between formats. It can merge and split PDFs. It can extract audio from video. It can even connect to AI APIs to do things like edit images or generate content.

And it does all of this with simple, natural language commands. No complicated syntax. No remembering ffmpeg flags. No uploading sensitive files to random websites.

Just: "Split this video in half." Done.

I discovered this by accident a few weeks ago, and since then, I've canceled three app subscriptions. Things I was paying monthly for. Things that did ONE task each.

Claude Code does all of them.

So let me show you what 90% of users are missing. Five capabilities that turn Claude Code from a coding assistant into the only file manipulation tool you'll ever need.

Let's dive in.

## HOOK 6: The "Stop Using These Apps" (Contrarian)

Stop paying for these apps.

I'm serious. Take out your phone right now and look at your subscriptions. If any of these are on there, you're wasting money.

CloudConvert. Zamzar. SmallPDF. Convertio. HandBrake - okay, that one's free, but you're still wasting time learning it. Any online file conversion service. Any PDF tool. Any video processing app.

You don't need them anymore.

If you have Claude Code - and let's be honest, if you're watching this video, you probably do - you already have everything those apps offer. You just haven't realized it yet.

And I'm not talking about some complicated workaround where you have to write scripts and debug code. I'm talking about typing "merge these PDFs" and watching it happen.

I'm talking about typing "convert this video to MP4" and having it done in under a minute.

I'm talking about replacing a dozen single-purpose apps with one tool you already have open.

In the next fifteen minutes, I'm going to show you five real tasks I used to pay for - video splitting, image conversion, PDF manipulation, audio extraction, and AI image editing.

All of them: done in Claude Code. All of them: faster than the apps I was paying for. All of them: zero additional cost.

By the end of this video, you're going to have some subscriptions to cancel.

Let's get started.

## SCRIPT NOTES

**Recommended Hook for Launch:** Hook 3 (The Realization) or Hook 4 (The One-Liner Reveal)
- Hook 3 is more story-driven, builds emotional connection
- Hook 4 is more punchy, immediately demonstrates value

**B-Roll Suggestions:**
- Screen recording of the subscription cancellation flow
- Split screen showing app interfaces vs Claude Code terminal
- Quick cuts of each task being completed
- Credit card being put away (for subscription cancel angle)

**Tone:** Conversational, slightly incredulous, building to excitement
