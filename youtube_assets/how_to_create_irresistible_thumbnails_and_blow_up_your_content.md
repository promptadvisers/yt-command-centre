## Transcript

Today we're talking about thumbnails. If
you want more views on YouTube, you have
to make better thumbnails. This is such
a critical piece that most people
overlook. Because here's the truth that
will really shock you. The game of
YouTube, it's not about who can make the
best videos. It's really about who can
get the most people to click on their
thumbnails and then watch a great video.
It seems trivial, but it's actually the
thumbnails that can make or break a
channel. Now, I've been studying the
biggest YouTube channels in the world,
and it turns out they're all using the
exact same thumbnail strategy. So, in
this video, I'm going to break the whole
thing down. This is the five-step
playbook for making irresistible
thumbnails that will supercharge your
views. And by the way, I'm Callaway. I
have a million followers. I've done
billions of views, and content is all I
ndo all day long. All right. Now, before
we get into it, let me just quickly say,
if you don't think thumbnails are that
important, look at this. This is my best
performing video of all time. 1.2 2
million views and that's the thumbnail.
Well, it turns out I actually made that
video 6 months before and posted it on a
different channel with this thumbnail.
And on that channel, it capped out at
1,700 views. Same exact video. The only
difference was the channel and a
different thumbnail. And this single
thumbnail change has been responsible
for six figures in revenue for my
business. That's how important
thumbnails are. All right. Now, before
we get into the five tactical steps for
how to make a thumbnail, it's super
helpful to understand the psychology of
viewer behavior on YouTube. And when I
say psychology, what I really mean is
the process a viewer goes through to
decide which video to click on. Now,
you'd think the viewer psychology would
be pretty straightforward. They see a
picture, they click a picture, they
watch the video, they're happy. But
that's not exactly how it works. The
psychology flow for viewers on YouTube
happens in three steps. The first thing
that happens is what I call the visual
stun gun. A viewer is scrolling the
explore feed or browsing the sidebar and
they see something visual that catches
their eye and this freezes their passive
scanning brain and engages a more active
target lock. Essentially, they switch
into a comprehension mode and they're
actively trying to figure out what it is
that grabbed their attention. So, step
one is that visual stun gun. You need to
make the thumbnail compelling enough to
visually trigger that stun gun effect.
And there's actually seven different
things you can do in the thumbnail
design to give yourself the best chance
to create that stun gun reaction. And
I'm going to walk through those in a
minute. But step one is that visual
stun. Now, once the viewer is locked on
and they've switched from a passive
scrolling to an active comprehension
mode, their interest is peaked. So then
all they want to do is fully understand
what the video could be about and what's
in it for them. And here's a critical
piece in the psychology flow. Typically,
the viewer is not able to gather a full
understanding of what the video is about
from just the thumbnail alone. It may
peak a ton of curiosity, but the image
alone will not get them to click. And
so, this is where step two happens,
where they shift their attention from
the image down to the title. And they do
this because words are easier to
concretely understand than images.
Images give us more data, but they're
often up to interpretation. Words are
much clearer and more specific. So, in
step two, the viewer then reads the
title to get a more direct sense of what
the video is going to be about. And I
call step two title value hunting. The
viewer is essentially looking at the
title to understand if they should opt
into watching because it's going to
offer some value for them. This is why
the title and thumbnail together are
often referred to as YouTube packaging.
You really can't win without optimizing
for both and the viewer consumes both at
the same time. Now, I'll explain in a
minute how to optimize the clarity and
clickability of the title, but just to
reframe where we're at so far in the
psychology flow. So far, the viewer
started paying attention from the visual
stun gun and then gut check the
relevance of the video for them in the
title value hunting. Now, here is where
things get interesting. After value
hunting the title, they still won't
click because step three is when the
viewer goes back up to the thumbnail to
more deeply comprehend what's in it. And
this is called visual validation. Now
that the viewer has a firmer grasp of
the topic and the promise made in the
title, they can anchor when visually
trying to comprehend what's going on in
the thumbnail. If the thumbnail does a
good job of supporting the value
promised by the title, and the viewer
wants that value, they're going to
click. So, the psychology flow is
thumbnail to title back to thumbnail.
That's how a viewer consumes the
information and decides to click. It's
visual stun gun to title value hunting,
back to visual validation. And
understanding this flow is so important
because it explains why certain YouTube
packaging works better than others. If
you have a thumbnail design that's easy
to understand, but it doesn't pop
visually, then you'll never pass the
visual stun gun phase. If you have a
thumbnail that visually grabs attention,
but the title promise is weak, then it's
going to get somebody to look at it, but
they won't click because the promise
isn't compelling. If you have a strong
title and a visually interesting image,
but the elements in the thumbnail
themselves don't support that title
promise, then the viewer is not going to
click because they'll be confused. When
you make your thumbnails, you want to
gut check through all three phases in
the flow. And if you don't believe me
that this works, go ahead and glance
down at the sidebar right now. The first
thing you did was look at one of those
thumbnail visuals. I guarantee you did
not read the titles first. Now, based on
that first look, you probably didn't
fully absorb what the video was going to
be about. you just saw bright colors or
a big face. So then before you click,
you'd actually have to look at the title
to try to figure out what's going to
happen in the video. And after that,
you'd look back up at the thumbnail to
gauge if the elements indicated trust
that the promise communicated in the
title would be delivered. It's not a
magic trick. This is how the brain
comprehends video options on YouTube.
And all of that that I just described
typically happens in 1 to two seconds
for the viewer. What a fun game. All
right. All right. Now, I promised I'd
give you some tactical ways to improve
your successes at each of those three
psychology steps. So, here's what's on
deck for the rest of this video. First,
I'm going to break down the tactical
enhancements that you can make at each
of the three steps in the psychology
flow that we just walked through. The
visual stun gun, the title value hunt,
and the visual validation. Then, I'm
going to give you the full five-step
formula for how to actually create a
winning thumbnail for every single
video. This will become your thumbnail
playbook. Think of it like a checklist
for how to approach making thumbnails.
And then finally, at the end, I'm going
to rapid fire a bunch of nonobvious but
tactical lessons that I've picked up
over the last couple months as we've
grown on YouTube. All right, let's dive
into
it. So, to revisit the three psychology
steps that we just went through, visual
stun gun, title value hunting, visual
validation. Let's start with the visual
stun gun. What can we do in the
thumbnail to create this visual stun gun
effect? Now, by definition, you need the
thumbnail to grab the viewers's
attention immediately. And like I said,
they're not going to comprehend the full
thing at this stage, but we just need
something to pop to turn that passive
scanning into active comprehension
seeking. This is the red berries and the
green leaf effect. Something visual has
to grab their attention. Now, as I
mentioned, there's seven categories of
things that you could put in your
thumbnail to increase your chances that
this effect occurs. The first one is to
use specific color science to create
visual contrast in the thumbnail. Now,
this means you can either use
contrasting colors within your thumbnail
or make your entire thumbnail a color
that contrasts with other competitor
videos in your niche. Doing this within
your thumbnail would be using vivid or
bright colors that pop against the
background. And this could be orange
elements against a blue background or
white elements against a dark background
or vice versa. The best example of this
is Ryan Tran's thumbnail from this video
here. That orange jumpsuit pops against
a black and white background so well.
Now, color contrast against your
category would be doing something like
making a lighter thumbnail when all of
your competitors use dark themes. And
that's what we've done on my channel,
which is why our thumbnails pop so well.
Essentially, this tactic would be to use
color to create some visual pop. Now,
the second way to trigger the visual
stun gun is to use a large face on the
image. And this can either be a
recognizable face like a celebrity or a
famous creator or a non-recognizable
face with a recognizable emotion. The
truth is, when you're starting out on
your own channel, you're a relative
nobody. And so, the recognizability
factor of your own face is extremely
low. And so, using yourself when you're
small doesn't really help you. In fact,
it may hurt you if people don't trust
that you can fulfill the promise based
on the way you look. But creating the
right emotion on your face, typically
shock or surprise, can supersede the
fact that nobody recognizes who you are.
Now, the third option for creating this
visual stud effect would be to use some
visually compelling graphic. essentially
some visual that draws attention because
of the bright colors or the way it's
designed. For example, this video on my
channel about psychology, we used a
phone graphic, but we put that optical
illusion pattern to immediately draw
your attention. The fourth thing you
could add would be large text, big
numbers, or dollars in huge font on the
screen. And this works because people's
brains are like magnets to words,
especially if they're big, round
numbers. And of course, I use this
tactic all the time in my thumbnails.
And you can see a couple examples of
that here and here. Now, fifth would be
to use red circles or red arrows to
literally aim someone's attention for
where you want them to look. Sixth would
be using aesthetic imagery, something
cinematic or super soothing to look at,
symmetrical or with balanced colors. I
don't typically do this style on my
channel, but this guy right here is a
master at this type of thumbnail. And
seventh would be to use some sort of
designbased collage, either words or
numbers all around the subject to create
that kind of collage effect. And you can
see an example of us doing this on our
channel where it worked really well.
Now, in a second, I'm going to give you
a lot more tips about how many of those
elements you should use, where you
should place them, and how to go about
actually designing the thumbnail. But
just remember, in step one, all you
really need is to create that initial
visual stun effect so that they look
down at the title. All right, let's keep
going. Okay, so step two in the
psychology flow is title value hunting.
And this is when the viewer goes from
the thumbnail down to the title to
actively comprehend and try to figure
out if this video is going to be
valuable for them. Now, I'm not going to
go all the way down the rabbit hole into
titles in this video because it would
just be way too long. But the secret to
writing a great title is that you want
to create a perceived value loop. A
perceived value loop is when the viewer
has clarity on the value they will
receive if they click and watch. For
educational videos, I call this a desire
loop. And for entertainment videos, I
call this an interest loop. A desire
loop is when you use words to trigger a
pain point that's preventing a desire
they want. Maybe it's money, growth, or
followers. An interest loop is when you
use words to trigger their curiosity
around a question that they have that's
unanswered. And this could be broader.
What happens next? How might this end?
What might this character do? So, let's
look at my YouTube script writing video,
which has 150,000 views, and kind of
break down what we did to create this
desire loop. The title for this was how
to write a killer script that keeps
viewers hooked. And of course, my
content is educational, so I'm working
with a desire loop instead of an
interest loop here. And the desire I'm
trying to trigger with this title is
reminding you that you want your viewers
to watch your stuff for longer. And the
title directly triggers that desire by
saying the words that keeps viewers
hooked. Now, to make sure that I open
that desire loop in your mind, I also
reference the pain point you have,
writing bad scripts, by suggesting a
solution that I have, writing killer
scripts. And at this point, if the
viewer has that desire, getting people
to watch and stay watching, and the pain
point their scripts aren't that good,
they're going to be extremely eager to
want to click. And this is just base
psychology at the most fundamental
level. This whole thumbnail game is just
a cat-and- mouse game of desire and
trust. Does the viewer desire what
you're saying or showing in the title
thumbnail? And then, do they trust that
you're going to be the one to deliver it
based on what you show in the thumbnail?
So tactically, if you're trying to
increase the chances that the viewer
goes from the title back up to the
thumbnail and clicks, you need to make
sure that title triggers the desire loop
that you want to trigger. And we'll dive
much deeper into that on a future video
on titles specifically. All right. Now,
the third step in this psychology flow,
visual validation, is really where the
thumbnail design really comes into play.
Because at this point, the viewer is
ready to opt in and they have that
written clarity on what the title is
saying. So now they're going back to the
thumbnail to try to confirm the
comprehension of what the image is
showing. And this is where we're going
to focus on which elements to include,
how many you should include, and why.
Now, at this point, you'll realize you
don't want the thumbnail to repeat what
the title is saying directly. And this
is because you want to think of the
thumbnail as an additional surface that
you can add trust and clarity for when
they click that they'll get the promise
made in the title. So, in this case with
my script writing video, I use that
squiggly storyline in the background and
then the words basically cheating to
reinforce the perception that yes, I
have a script writing method that feels
like cheating that will solve your pain
point of writing bad scripts and fulfill
the desire you have, which is to keep
viewers watching. Now, let's break down
the action steps and general guidelines
for what you should include in your
thumbnail so that you can increase this
comprehension moment and get people to
click. The first rule is that you want
three elements max in the design.
There's seven categories, but you only
want to use three of them. And this is
because thumbnails are actually pretty
small when people look at them,
especially on mobile. If you use too
many small elements, they're not
actually going to be able to see or
comprehend what they're showing. Now,
for me, in my thumbnails, we typically
use a picture of me, some text, and then
some graphic element. If you're using a
face, make sure the emotion on the face
matches the emotion that a viewer should
feel when they watch the video. This is
why the Mr. Beast shock face is so
popular. He's trying to subconsciously
trigger that you will be shocked if you
click and watch. Now, if you use big
text on the screen, you need it to
complement and reinforce the promise
made in the title. And again, for this
script writing example, I use the words
basically cheating. We could have
written something like scriptw writing
masterclass, but that would have been
redundant to what was communicated
already in the title. It's always more
powerful to describe the silent feeling
or action that someone's going to have
versus the redundant descriptor of
what's going to go on. This title text
plus thumbnail text needs to increase
comprehension and trust, not be neutral
or decrease it. And then lastly, if you
use some graphic or visual element, it
needs to be clear what this actually
represents. For example, in this
thumbnail, we knew the video was going
to be about editing, and so we use this
arc version of the timeline to represent
that visually. All right. Now, before I
go on to break down the tactical
five-step formula, I just wanted to
mention if you're trying to get better
with content and you're not currently a
member of Wavy World, you definitely
should be. Wavy World is my content
community with over 19,000
entrepreneurs, creators, and business
owners that are all working together to
improve their content, and it's
completely free to join. I've got an
invite link for you in the description.
All right, now that we've done a full
deep dive on the psychology, I want to
break down the tactical five-step
playbook for how to actually make
thumbnails. Hopefully, this will become
a checklist and guide every time you
make a video. Okay, now step one is the
approach. You need to approach making
your thumbnail as if it's the most
important part of the video. And that's
because it is. And Mr. Beast is famous
for saying this. If they don't click,
they don't watch. And if they don't
watch, there's really no point in even
making the video in the first place. So,
this means you need to be taking a
professional approach to making
thumbnails. Now, if you're like me and
you're a business owner that's trying to
take YouTube seriously, that means you
should be outsourcing thumbnails
immediately. As soon as I realized just
how important thumbnails were to winning
on YouTube, I hired a pro as fast as I
could. If you want the intro to my
preferred thumbnail agency, I've got the
link below in the description. You could
also try to find and hire thumbnail
designers directly using sites like
onlinejob.ph or ytjob.co or you could go
to Upwork. We also have a bunch of
thumbnail designers in Wavyworld that
are always looking to partner with
different creators. But I will say all
of those other routes require a bunch of
leg work because you have to sort
through applications. But regardless of
who you find or where you find them, I
recommend hiring a thumbnail designer
immediately. Now, don't worry if you
can't afford to outsource this yet. I've
got the full playbook coming right here.
All right, so let's move on to step two,
the curiosity gap, desire loops,
painoint, and solutions. Before you
actually break ground on designing the
image, you want to ask yourself, what is
the desire or interest loop that I'm
trying to create with this packaging?
Now, for the rest of this video, I'm
going to be talking about the playbook
from an educational point of view, but
the same thing works for entertainment.
So, if I was going through this process,
I would ask myself, what is the desire
loop for this video? And typically for
educational content, the core desire is
going to be making money, saving time,
or getting healthy. And each of these
obviously can be achieved in different
ways. For my content personally, I'm
laser focused on helping business owners
improve their content to grow their
businesses. And so, the desire loop in
my videos is helping people grow faster
or make better content. So from there,
once you have the desire loop, you then
need to identify the specific pain point
and solution that makes sense for this
specific video. So let's take one of my
recent videos as an example to break
down this formula. This is a video where
I talk about how I went from zero to
100K on YouTube in just 5 months. Now,
the pain point I'm targeting for the
viewer is I'm growing too slow on
YouTube and I want to grow faster. And
the solution is I have ways and methods
that I use to grow faster that I can
share with you. Now, the curiosity loop
that I'm trying to build in your brain
from this specific packaging is if I
click on this video, will I be able to
grow faster on YouTube? And of course,
the desire loop again is I want to grow
faster on YouTube. So, before you
actually break ground on the thumbnail
and title, you kind of need to have this
dialed in your head. And now we can move
on to step three, which is concepting
the elements and composition of the
thumbnail design. Okay, so in step
three, we're going to start figuring out
the exact elements we want to use and
the composition of the image. And now I
already talked about those seven core
elements and the fact that really you
should only use three maxs in your
design. And as a reminder, these are the
core elements. Faces with emotion,
visually compelling graphics, large text
numbers or dollars, aesthetic imagery,
or maximalist design collages. We also
mentioned red circles and arrows and
color contrast. But those two things can
kind of be used in conjunction with the
first five elements because they're more
complimentary. So, when you're coming up
with a concept for your thumbnails, I
recommend coming up with the elements
first and then you can figure out the
composition for layout in a minute. Now,
I'll explain more specific tactics on
how to make each of those better in a
second. But just at this stage in step
three, you're just concepting and
sketching to try to get a sense for what
those elements could be. This is the
measure twice, cut once of the design
process. What we like to do is make a
list of the full graphic items or text
phrases that we might be able to use
just so we have options to pull from.
Now, once you have that list and kind of
a sense for what those elements could
be, the next thing you want to figure
nout is the composition of those elements
on the page. And again, we haven't
designed them yet. This is just a
lowquality sketch with pencil that takes
na few seconds, but just to try to lay it
out in your head for what it might look
like. Now, for composition inspiration,
essentially what the image could look
like, it's usually helpful to look at
other competition in your niche that has
done well. And you can do that with one
of 10 or Vid IQ. There are typically
three main types of composition. The
first one is symmetrical where the main
subject is in the middle and then either
side is relatively the same. The second
is asymmetrical where based on the rule
of thirds the main subject is either a
third on the left or right and then you
fill out the remainder of the image. And
the third composition is AB where the
screen is actually split into two and
you're showing a transformation from A
nto B. And I've had success with all
three composition types on my channel.
It just depends on what the specific
design calls for and what we're trying
to get across. Okay, so that was step
three. You've brainstormed and ideulated
what some of the right elements and text
items could be. You've sketched the
composition and you have a general sense
for what the image should look like. All
right. Now, step four is to actually
design the full image. And I'm not a pro
graphic designer. That's why I partnered
with a thumbnail expert. But here are
some specific tips for how to increase
the effectiveness of your thumbnail
design. Overall, you want all of the
graphic elements as high quality as you
can possibly get them. You want the text
easy to read and everything well spaced
so it doesn't look too crowded. Make
sure to apply saturation or color
adjustments so that things look brighter
versus duller. If you need to upscale an
image because it's too grainy at the
size you're dragging it, I like to use
magnific.ai. Now, if you're using a
visual graphic as one of your three
elements, you want it to be something
that immediately represents the desire
loop. And the desire loop is basically
the transformation that somebody wants.
So, there are four simple ways you can
think about what that graphic could be.
And I'm going to show you each one using
a thumbnail from Ali Abdal. The first
option is to show the end state of what
someone wants. This could be like a
PayPal screenshot showing the dollars
earned in their account. The second
option is to show some visual from a
process or visualize the full process
that they would go through in the
transformation. The third option is to
literally show the before and after. And
this works really well with the split
screen or an arrow from one to the
other. And then the fourth option would
be to use a graphic to show the
anti-transformation state or the pain
point. Remind them of the pain that
you're helping them solve. So that's for
the graphic. Now, when it comes to
selecting the text that goes on the
screen with the graphic, you want the
person to read the text and immediately
remember either the pain that they feel
or the solution that they'll solve after
they watch. And these are basically two
sides of the same psychology coin. So,
for this thumbnail I just showed you,
Ali uses the word alone to re-trigger
the pain that it feels like when you're
lonely. But for this one, he references
the 108010 rule, which is a specific
solution for managing your time. So,
that's the text on the screen. Now, when
it comes to picking an image or a
person, try this. If your video actually
talks about some celebrity or personal
brand, consider using them in the
thumbnail. And this is because known
figures with personal brands have words
or terms that are already attached when
you see their faces. It's like increased
comprehension when you see them. But
don't use someone that doesn't represent
the desire loop you're communicating in
the title, or it may backfire. Now, if
your video doesn't really reference
anyone in your category, you could
consider using yourself as the subject
or face in the thumbnail. However, like
I said before, if nobody knows you, this
could backfire as a risk because they'll
decide they don't trust you because they
don't know you. Often times, if you're
newer, it could be better not to use a
face than to use one that's pretty
unknown. Of course, the design part of
this process takes a long time and a lot
of reps get good at, which is why
outsourcing to a professional is
recommended. Now, just to give you one
more example of my own videos breaking
down the final design, here's what we
were thinking through when we made the
thumbnail for this video. Again, this is
the one about my YouTube growth. So, for
this one, the elements we used were a
picture of me smiling, the YouTube
plaque, and then text that said, \"I did
it in 5 months.\" Now, the reason we used
me smiling in the photo is because we
wanted to symbolize the feeling that a
viewer would feel if they got their
channel to grow faster, happy. And the
text is pretty basic, but we underlined
the number five to emphasize how fast
the speed was. And then we included the
YouTube plaque because that plaque is a
representation for success on YouTube.
All these elements were selected
intentionally to trigger the desire loop
of someone wanting to grow faster on
YouTube. All right. Now, step five, the
last step in the process is testing.
Once you have the thumbnail designed,
you should use something like
clickpilot.app to see how it'll look in
the explore feed or in the sidebar. This
software also lets you pick specific
channels that you want to test your
thumbnails against that are often
competitors that will come up in other
viewers feeds. And lastly, and this is
super important, you should not leave
your video's performance up to chance
with just a single thumbnail. And I know
it's going to sound crazy after all the
work you just did, but you really should
be testing with at least three
thumbnails. The biggest channels in the
world run dozens of thumbnails against
each other for every single video.
Steven Bartlett apparently tests a
hundred different thumbnails for every
video of Diver CEO that he puts out. And
just to be transparent about what
actually goes on behind the scenes, for
this video, zero to 100K on YouTube, we
made seven different thumbnail designs,
and we ABC tested the best three. We
like to use YouTube's native ABC test
tool, but if you want to get crazier
with more options and title
combinations, you can use
thumbnailest.com to do that. Because the
truth is, even though we were pretty
sure we knew what would work in the
thumbnail, we didn't want to leave it up
to chance. And so that's why we pick
three options and let the market decide.
All right, so there you have it. That is
the five-step tactical playbook for how
to actually make thumbnails. Step one is
the approach. Step two is to define what
that desire loop is. Step three is
concepting. Step four is the design. And
then step five is testing. Now, before I
end this video, I just want to rapid
fire a bunch of non-obvious and tactical
learnings that we've picked up over the
last couple months really honing in our
thumbnail process. Number one is to use
green and red as colors to explain good
and bad. Any other colors are not going
to be as helpful because the
comprehension is not baked in
automatically. Number two, do not use a
design element that gets covered up in
the bottom right corner. If you look at
your channel, you'll see the timestamp
of all the videos overlaid here. And if
that blocks a certain word, like it's
doing on this video, it can be harder to
understand what's going on in the
thumbnail. Number three, if you want to
make it easier for your thumbnail
designer to make a ton of variations
with high quality imagery, you should
have one photo shoot session, take your
camera on 4K or record a video at 4K 60
frames per second and make a ton of
different poses. Here's what I
recommend. Varying emotions, happy, sad,
surprised, shocked, pointing up with the
right hand, up with the left hand, down
with the right hand, down with the left
hand, open hand, closed hand, a bunch of
different poses. It'll look crazy and
seem insane for 5 to 10 minutes. Do this
and then give them that file. All of a
sudden, they'll have tons of different
pictures to choose from and you'll never
have to photoshoot again. Number four,
I've mentioned a bunch of times in this
video, but just to reiterate, the
emotion on the face in the thumbnail is
actually a great way to subconsciously
skew what the promise will be to the
viewer. So, make sure you're using the
right emotion and you're taking enough
photos to give your thumbnail designer
options. Number five, don't use design
elements that are too small. Imagine
your thumbnail shown as 1/16th on a
iPhone 6 screen. This tiny little
screen, tiny little image, don't make
design elements too small. Make sure
they're big and only include three in
the frame. Number six, if you're
struggling to create separation between
you as your face and the background or
text in the background, use shadows.
Shadows and shading are a great way to
create visual separation. Number seven
is about clickbait. Everybody says you
don't want to clickbait. That's
completely false. You 100% want to bait
the click. That is your job with the
thumbnail. But clickbait is only
clickbait when the content doesn't match
the promise. If the content is good,
then baiting the click is simply
required to get people to watch. Number
eight is about building a thumbnail
swipe file. A good way to dial in your
style over time is to just have a folder
on your computer where anytime you see
an interesting thumbnail, screenshot and
dump it in. You can share that folder
with your thumbnail designer and they
can use that as a starter for ideas. You
can also go on one of 10 and Vid IQ and
use their thumbnail features to save
these as well. And the last tip, and
I'll say it again because it's so
important, do not wait until the last
hour to rush and try to throw together a
thumbnail before you post a video.
You're doing things in the wrong order.
If people don't click, they won't watch.
And then making the video is really
worthless if you can't get them to
click. This means you either need to
start your process making the thumbnail
or at least have a really good idea for
it or hire a professional to do this for
you. Like I said, the way I do this on
my channel to make it completely stress
free is I have an ideas team that comes
up with the ideas, comes up with the
titles, comes up with a thumbnail
design, and then I hand that dock to my
thumbnail designer who will design seven
options, and we can pressure test three.
If you want intros to both of those
parties, I've got links below. All
right, guys, that is all I've got for
this video, and we covered a ton of
ground. As a summary, first, we went
through the psychology flow of a viewer
on YouTube and how they decide which
video to click on. We also broke down
the seven different visual elements that
you can use to create that visual stun
gun effect. Then we walked through the
five-step tactical thumbnail playbook
that you can use as a checklist and a
guide moving forward for every video.
And lastly, we covered nine non-obvious
tactical tips, little things here and
there that would just boost your
performance over time. As always, I try
nto put everything I have into making the
best videos in the content creation
space. So, if you like this, please
like, subscribe, leave a comment, and
let me know what you want to watch next.
And also in the description, I have so
many other free resources and guides. I
really just want to see more people win.
So check those out and we will see you
guys on the next video. Peace.
