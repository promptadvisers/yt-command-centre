## Transcript

I've studied thousands of the biggest
creators in the world, and it turns out
they're all using the same storytelling
tactics to keep people hooked. So, in
this video, I'm going to break down all
of them. These are the nine best
psychology tactics that you can use to
keep people watching. And once you know
them, your storytelling will
dramatically improve. By the way, I'm
Callaway. I've got a million followers.
I've done a billion views. And
storytelling is all I do all day long.
All right. The first trick to keeping
viewers hooked is called comprehension
maxing. And this really is the golden
goose of storytelling psychology. If you
can do this, you will win as a
storyteller. Now, the best creators do
everything they can to max out viewer
comprehension. Comprehension is how well
a viewer actually understands what
you're saying in a video. So, when
someone starts watching, their
understanding is at 100%. But every
sentence, every graphic, every
additional word you say, that
comprehension has the potential to go
down. This is why retention charts look
the way they do. Every second more and
more people lose the grasp of their
understanding, get confused, and then
they bounce. When a viewer gets
confused, this is called comprehension
loss. They're literally losing an
understanding of what you're saying. And
when this happens enough time in the
video, they just stop watching because
nobody likes being confused. Now, the
easiest way to increase comprehension is
with visual matching. This means pairing
your words with the right visual so the
viewer can complete the comprehension
puzzle in their own head. The better the
visuals match the words, the more
comprehension will go up. And to show
you what I mean, I want you to watch the
intro to this video from Mr. Beast.
Behind me are a 100 circles with a 100
people inside of them. I don't care if
this takes weeks, months, or even a
year. The last one of you to leave your
circle wins that
$500,000. Now, Jimmy is one of the best
in the world at this. He says, "Behind
me are 100 circles with 100 people
inside them." And then he literally
shows you the 100 circles zooming out
with 100 people in them. Then he says,
"I don't care if this takes weeks,
months, or even a year." And then shows
a sped up time-lapse from the outside
with seasons changing and snow altering
on the mountains. These are examples of
matching the best possible visual with
the sentence he's saying. And if you
think this is happening by accident, it
isn't. His team spends hours
meticulously matching the visual shot
selection to go with his words. And it
seems simple, but doing this right
increases comprehension dramatically.
And when comprehension goes up, the
viewer stays hooked. And so the tactical
approach is for you to ask yourself for
every sentence I'm saying, what is the
best possible visual I could be using to
increase understanding. Sometimes no
visual is best, but almost always
there's something you can add to
increase comprehension and decrease
confusion. By the way, if you like the
way I do my visuals in these videos, I
have a link to my editors in the
description. All right, the second tip
for hooking viewers is to use hawkkeye
narratives when you're structuring your
story flow. If you think about a hawk,
it surveys the world from high in the
sky and then when it sees food, it dives
down to go get it. The best stories work
in the same way, broad and then deep.
This is why almost all movie scenes
start out with establishing shots first
before zooming into the character and
starting the action. It's easier for
viewers to buy into the plot and relate
to the stakes if they have the broader
context first. If you watch the scene
from Interstellar by Christopher Nolan,
you'll get exactly what I mean.
[Music]
[Music]
It's an Indian Air Force drone. Solar
cells can power an entire farm. Take the
wheel. This scene is from when Matthew
McConna is driving through the
cornfields chasing that drone. What
makes the scene most compelling is the
contrast between broad and narrow. You
can see the vastness of the fields, the
speed of the drone, the insignificance
of the truck relative to the land, and
then it zooms into the truck and you
hear the dialogue. The establishing
shots wide and then zooming back in
narrow is what creates the intrigue.
Great stories that hook you always have
this flow from wide to narrow. Now,
tactically, how might this Hawkeye
narrative framework apply to a more
educational or expertise style of
content like what I make? What you want
to do is try to give broad context for
why something matters and then explain
it from high to low. If you dive into
the tactics too quickly without
orientation, it leads to comprehension
loss. But if you never dive into the
tactics and always stay high level only
in strategy, then it's not actually
helpful for the viewer. See how I'm
presenting each of these points in this
video? It's context, then theory, then
examples with tactics, broad to narrow.
This is a better way to order
information, and it will hook viewers
more. All right. All right. Now, before
we keep going, if you like the way I
explain things and you want more
breakdowns of other parts of content
like this storytelling, but also editing
and ideas and packaging, I host a free
content community called Wavy World. And
we have over 15,000 creators,
entrepreneurs, all working together to
try to improve their content. I've got a
free invite link in the description for
you if you want to join. All right. Now,
another tactic the best creators use to
maximize retention is explaining complex
concepts using visual examples and
metaphors. This is such a hack if you
can get your brain to think in this way.
Visual examples work because they give a
viewer a second chance to understand the
concept in a real world setting. You say
something once and then you show it a
second time in a different way. And yep,
when you do this, it significantly
increases the comprehension of what
you're saying. A good example of this is
the way I've presented this video so
far. I share a tip, but then I reexlain
that tip using a complimentary visual,
something that makes it easier to see
the learning in action. Now, tactically,
if you want to get better at thinking in
metaphors, it can be super helpful to
look at the world around you and try to
relate things to one another. For
example, if I was trying to explain the
flow of storytelling, I might think
about a wave in the ocean. The tide
comes in and out. Tension builds and
release just like the flow of a story.
And the reason this works is because
more people have a pre-baked
understanding of the ocean than of
storytelling. And so, when I describe
something they know with something they
don't know, inherently it makes
comprehension go up. Effectively, to get
good at this, you have to train your
brain to start thinking in comparisons.
You're comparing one thing that's hard
to understand with another that's
easier. I found Steve Jobs was
incredible at this. Watch this clip of
him from the original iPhone keynote.
Why do we need a revolutionary user
interface? I mean, here's four
smartphones, right? Motorola Q, the
Blackberry, Palm Tree, Noki E62, the
usual suspects. And what's wrong with
their user interfaces? Well, the problem
with them is really sort of in the
bottom 40 there. It's it's this stuff
right
here. They all have these keyboards that
are there whether you need them or not
to be there. And they all have these
control buttons that are fixed in
plastic and are the same for every
application. Well, every application
wants a slightly different user
interface, a slightly optimized set of
buttons just for it. And what happens if
you think of a great idea 6 months from
now? You can't run around and add a
button to these things. They're already
shipped. So, what do you do? Hm. It
turns out we have solved it. We solved
it in computers 20 years ago. We solved
it with a bit mapap screen that could
display anything we want. Put any user
interface up and a pointing device. We
solved it with the mouse. So, how are we
going to take this to a mobile device?
But what we're going to do is get rid of
all these buttons and just make a giant
screen. A giant
screen. Now, how are we going to
communicate this? We don't want to carry
around a mouse, right? So, what are we
going to do? Oh, a stylus, right? We're
going to use a
stylus.
No. Now, who wants a
stylus? You have to get them and put
them away and you lose them. Yuck.
Nobody wants a stylus. So, let's not use
a
stylus. We're going to use the best
pointing device in the world. We're
going to use a pointing device that
we're all born with. We're born with 10
of them. We're going to use our fingers.
Now, in this clip, Steve is explaining
why they built touch controls into the
original iPhone. And he could have just
explained that core functionality in
words. He could have even showed it in a
live demo. But instead, the most
compelling visual option was to show the
mechanical keyboards from the previous
versions. This again helps increase
comprehension because the iPhone was
better. It gives it something to compare
it against. Tactically, if you want to
use more visual examples and metaphors
in your own videos, you need to ask
yourself, what common thing in the world
is a strong representation of the
uncommon thing I'm trying to explain.
All right. Now, the fourth tactic for
hooking viewers is to establish common
ground as quickly as you can. The best
creators are super good at this. They
want you to see yourself in them. And to
do this, they use relatable characters,
scenes, references to people, little
things that make you relate. One of the
best ways to get people to understand
you is to show that you understand them.
For example, I try to speak to you, not
just from the perspectives of me or I.
And that helps build common ground
between us. And the reason building
common ground works so well is buried
deep in our subconscious psychology. The
human brain is trained to search for
relatability. This is because as
children, we were trained to locate our
parents in a crowd full of strangers for
safety. So when you see or hear
something that you already understand,
it subconsciously relaxes the brain. It
helps you relate. It builds that common
ground. Now, two great examples of this
are Casey Neistat and Ali Abdal. And
they build common ground in completely
different ways. For Casey, he uses the
visual consistency of his vibe,
location, his studio, his office, his
sunglasses to create a visual
consistency from video to video. After
you've been exposed to it once, you know
what to expect. And you get that common
relatability feeling from every video
after. And this is a more subtle way of
building common ground. It's less of him
relating to you directly and more of you
getting more of the authentic version of
him over and over and over. It's that
consistency that soos the brain. Now,
this other example of Ali Abdal is even
better at this. Broadly, two different
options. Option number one is you've
just got to suffer. It's called work for
a reason. Work is not supposed to be
enjoyable. It's just capitalism. It's
just government. It's a system. There's
nothing you can do about it. You might
as well just sort of grin and bear it.
And then option number two that is often
pedled by online influencer type people
including me in fairness is that hey if
you don't like your job it's an option.
In this video Ali is talking about
hating your job and trying to get out of
it as a point of commonality between him
and the viewer. He then shows visual
examples from the Incredibles Fight Club
and even him in his office looking
miserable. And this subconsciously
builds common ground between him and you
and then both of you in relation to
those pop culture references. He does
this super early on in the video to make
sure that common ground is immediately
established. And by doing this, you want
to listen to what he says because it
feels like he gets you. So tactically in
your own videos, what you want to do is
try to build common ground, either
through lived experience, the things you
show on camera, or the words you use to
explain your concepts. If you can build
that common ground and connection
quicker, the sooner someone will opt in
to wanting to hear what you say. All
right. Another super helpful tactic for
hooking the viewer is by using simpler
words and simpler ideas. And I know this
seems counterintuitive. You'd think the
more complex and unique your ideas, the
more differentiated you would seem and
the more your content would cut through.
But this is the wrong way to think about
it. Complex ideas are only interesting
if someone understands them. And the
more complex the words, the harder it is
to keep that comprehension high. So a
trick is to just use simpler words. Say
less things more concisely in a simpler
framing because the truth is the core
reason for the idea is why people say
the simplicity in your delivery will
actually just increase hookability. Now
good examples of this are of course Mr.
Beast and even Ryan Treyan with his
penny to $1,000 series. This is a penny
and my fingernail fell off. I turned a
penny into $1,000 in high school.
However, I used things like the
internet, my car, and my low self-esteem
and it took me 40 days. Well, today I
only have 24 hours and this bike and my
phone and still still the low
self-esteem as well. It all starts
right
now. Now, start the clock. Start the
These are super simple ideas and if you
watch them explain them in the intro,
they use super short sentences, simple
words, and basic phrasing. Again,
there's a reason why these ideas do so
well. The secret is in the clarity. Now,
if you make more expertise or
educational style content, how can you
translate this learning for your stuff?
The process is to be constantly remixing
down to the atomic unit of the words.
You need to think simpler, simpler,
simpler, so that a smart 8-year-old
would fully understand what you're
saying. And again, to build on previous
concepts, using visuals is a great way
to bridge this gap. The honest truth is,
people don't like feeling dumb. If you
were to click on an organic chemistry
lesson from Harvard, how long would you
keep watching? Not very long. It's
because most people wouldn't understand
what they're saying. The complexity of
the topics create confusion and nobody
likes that. The simpler and clearer the
better. Trust me. All right. The sixth
tip for hooking viewers is by using a
visual stun gun. And this is a super
powerful concept if you can understand
it. I view visuals in two ways. One way
is to increase comprehension and the
other is to use a visual stun gun to
hold attention just long enough to make
your point. The best creators use visual
matching for the comprehension and then
visual switching for the stun gun.
Visual switching is just the speed with
which visuals change on the screen. And
there's a sweet spot of visual pacing
that keeps the viewer subconscious brain
busy without being overwhelmed. And I
think of this like a stun gun. I don't
want to overwhelm you. I just want to
stun you long enough to hold your
attention. Now, someone that does this
really well on the slower end is MKBHD.
He has a super relaxed, not over-the-top
editing style. And when you study the
pacing of his switches on the timeline,
you can tell it's designed to be just
fast enough to hold your attention.
Someone who does this on the fast end is
Mr. Who's the Boss. And I wouldn't go
any faster or crazier than he does
because really the editing trend is to
slow down. But the range between MKBHD
and Mr. Who's the Boss is where you
should be on your visual switching
pacing. You could actually put one of
each video on the timeline and then mark
every time a visual changes. That'll
give you a sense for exactly where the
range is. And remember, jump cuts also
count for visual switching. So, it
doesn't have to just be B-rolls or
graphics, but you want to change
something on the screen every certain
amount of seconds. All right. Now,
another easy way to hook the viewer is
to just give them what they want, but do
it sooner. This is called value
compression. Bring the part they
actually want up earlier in the video so
that if they bounce after a few minutes,
at least they're leaving with something
valuable. Most people are afraid to give
the good stuff early because they think
people won't stay until the end. I think
this is nonsense. I'd rather give you
something valuable than nothing if
you're going to leave after 4 minutes.
And if you just elevate all of your
stuff, then you've got good stuff at the
beginning and the end. Now, a great
example of this is Hormosi in this
video. I've been in business for 13
years, and since 2020, three of the
companies I started have reached $100
million plus valuation. Here's no BS
advice to help you crush 2025. My first
piece of advice is set fewer goals and
do less long-term plan. He got to the
first valuable tip like 12 seconds in.
immediate compression and immediately
hooked. The tactical adjustment here is
to write your intro. Then reread it and
cut every single sentence that doesn't
need to be there. Anything that's fluff,
cut it. No need for a windup. Just pitch
the ball immediately. And this is so
important that after my videos are
edited, before I post, I'll go one more
time through and I'll cut every sentence
that I don't think is needed, even if
the graphics look great. Value
compression is something that you can
focus on right away and immediately
level up your videos. All right. Now,
the easiest way to hook viewers for
longer, especially if you make
educational or expertise style content,
is to come with proof. This is a really
easy way to psychologically hook
someone. Just prove you've done the
thing you say you've done subliminally
and lock in that trust from the
beginning. And this can, can of course
be done in the cringy way, like the
sleas balls wearing Rolexes to try to
sell you their course, or also in a
super positive way, literally showing
screenshots and receipts and proof.
Either way, the faster you can get to
proof, the easier it will be to hook
someone that wants to achieve a similar
outcome. And the reason for this is
because of your subconscious BS
detector. When people watch educational
content, they're always mapping what
they're hearing against what they
believe to be true or BS. And authentic
proof is the easiest way to assuage
these concerns because you immediately
trust someone more if what they're
saying has been proven to work before.
Now, the best example of this in the
business niche is Hormosi. Again, watch
this intro with him. If we were to just
triple and get to a million this year,
would you be okay with that? We're gonna
make you so much money. This is Ashley.
She runs a personal styling business.
And my name is Alex Moszie and I own
acquisition.com, which is a portfolio of
companies that makes more money than I
will ever need for the rest of my life.
And so today, Ashley will be explaining
to me her biggest business challenges.
And I'm going to try to help her scale
her business to a million dollars in
revenue and beyond. He almost always
qualifies his advice with proof of his
background so you can trust what he's
saying immediately. And this is just
enough to disarm your BS detector. The
truth is, tactically, if you want to get
better at this, the best way to come
with proof is to actually have proof.
And so, if you don't have any proof, go
get some proof in a small way. Work for
free for one client so you have
something to share. I'm telling you,
having proof makes a massive, massive
difference, especially with educational
and expertise style content. All right.
Now, tip number nine. I saved the best
for last. This really is the secret
weapon behind all the world's greatest
storytellers. They set up contrast. Now,
contrast is just the difference between
expectations and reality. I believe this
thing, you told me that thing. That
difference is contrast. They get you
leaning one way and then they reveal
some new information, some twist, some
other scenario, and snap you back to the
other way. The root of all great hooking
is contrast. And funny enough, people do
this all the time in regular everyday
conversation if you know how to look for
it. They'll start out saying, you know,
that was cool, but this this is really
really cool. That's contrast. They just
don't know they're doing it. Now, I've
talked a lot about contrast before on
this channel because it's so so
important to getting your stories to
actually stick. The truth is, it's as
simple as this. The bigger the contrast,
the more hooked you'll be. Now,
tactically, if you want to start
creating better contrast in your videos,
you need to figure out what the base
expectation actually is. What's the
common belief that most people would
hold and then how can you contradict
against it? And this applies to both
educational and entertainment content.
All content has contrast and the best
contrast creates the best hook. Think
about this. Is Prince Charming fighting
a dragon interesting? Well, kind of. But
what's more interesting is Prince
Charming on a horse walking calmly
through the forest and then a dragon
appearing. It's the change in state that
creates intrigue, not just the state.
All right, guys. That's all I've got for
this video. As always, please let me
know what you thought of this one in the
comments so that I can keep getting
better for next time. And remember,
there is so much free stuff in the
description. If you're trying to get
better with content, check all that
stuff out. I promise it will help you.
And with that, we will see you guys on
the next one. Peace.
