## Transcript

Today we're talking about ideas. If you
want your videos to perform better, you
have to improve your idea process. This
is the most important aspect of content.
Nothing else matters if the idea is
weak. Now, here's the truth about ideas
that may surprise you. The top creators
you look up to, they're all using the
exact same process to find and develop
their ideas. They've all built an idea
mining system, and that really is the
secret for how they're growing so fast.
Their ideas are just better. So, in this
video, I'm going to walk through the
step-by-step process for how you can
build the exact same idea mining system
for yourself. It's just three steps, and
if you do this, I guarantee your videos
will perform better. I know this works
because content is all I do all day
long. I have a million followers. I've
done billions of views, and my idea
mining system is the reason I can go
viral whenever I want. All right. Now,
before I break down the process on how
to build the idea mining system, let's
just get crystal clear on what a video
idea actually is, cuz it's probably not
what you think. Most people think the
video idea is just the topic. But that's
only one small piece of it. A video idea
is made up of seven different
components. I call these idea Legos. You
have the topic, but you also have the
angle, the hook, the story structure,
the visual format, the key visuals, and
the audio. Think of these seven
different components as Lego bricks that
assemble together to create a unique
video idea. Now, let's just define each
of these seven pieces very quickly so
you know exactly what I'm talking about.
The topic is the one sentence simple
description of what the video is about.
But the angle is the combination of the
premise, take, and interesting key facts
that are used to explain the topic. So,
you could have two branding videos about
Apple. One of them about the history of
their logo design and the other one
about a specific ad campaign from 2004.
These are very different videos. Similar
topic, completely different angles.
Okay, let's keep going. The hook
structure is made up of three parts. The
spoken hook, what is said. The text
hook, the text that is shown on screen,
and the visual hook, what is shown and
how it's shown. The story structure is
the way the story is delivered. Could be
a breakdown, a listical, a tutorial.
Think of it like story blocks or an
outline structure that determines how
the story flows. The visual format is
the way the video is laid out visually.
Could be green screen, could be a POV
vlog, could be a faceless music only
text conversation. There are dozens and
dozens of winning visual formats. But
just think of this like the visual
layout of the video. Then we have the
key visuals, which are the actual
visuals used in the layout. It's what's
actually shown on screen. The A-roll,
the B-roll, the animations, etc. The
visual format is how the visuals are
laid out and sequenced. The key visuals
are the visuals themselves. And then
lastly, you have audio, which is either
the background music or sound effects.
Now, every video is a combination of
these seven Lego bricks. And this is
really important because knowing this
and thinking in these Lego brick terms
will completely change the way you find
and develop video ideas. So, as we build
the system for finding better ideas,
just keep those seven Lego bricks in
mind. We'll come back to those in a
second. Okay, now let's get to the good
stuff. This is the three-step system for
coming up with better content ideas so
that you get more views and grow faster
on social media. Step one is called
outlier research. The first step in the
process is to find other videos in your
niche that have already performed well.
We call these outliers and we measure
them using an outlier score. An outlier
score takes the views of one video
divided by the average views of that
channel. So, for example, if some video
gets 100,000 views and the average views
on that channel is around 10,000, that
would be an outlier score of 10x. Now,
outlier scoring is really important
because it helps us compare different
sized channels apples to apples. Small
channels typically don't get as many
views on average. But if they have a
banger video with a 50x outlier, then
that signals something different
happened there that's worth studying. So
outliers are the core to everything we
do when it comes to idea research. And
it makes sense, right? If I showed you a
hundred videos and said, "I'll give you
a million dollars if you can make one
that beats all 100." What would you do?
Well, the first thing is you would rank
the hundred from best to worst. And you
would study the best ones. You look for
gaps, identify where they were weak, and
then try to make your version better
than the weak points of the best videos.
Well, those best examples are called
outliers. They're the outperformers. All
right. Now, I'm going to explain exactly
where and how to find outliers in a
minute. But just know step one in the
process is that you need to build a
system for finding outliers in your
niche. Okay. Now, here's step two. Once
you find an outlier, you need to analyze
it across those seven Lego bricks. And
your goal is to find common patterns
across the winners. Maybe you notice
that six out of the top 10 performing
videos in your niche are all talking
about the same topic. Or maybe when you
zoom out and analyze the top 50 best
performers, you keep seeing the same
visual format that grabs your attention
over and over. These patterns are
indicating there is a proven answer for
that Lego brick in your niche. That
insight is gold because what you're
really doing when you analyze the
patterns is letting the data tell you
what works best. See, if you've ever
tried to make content before and it
hasn't worked, well then the number one
question on your mind is why isn't it
working? And the reason why it isn't
working is because you're guessing at
what might work across all seven of
those Lego bricks. You probably came up
with an unvalidated topic, had a random
take, tried some story structure or hook
structure that was unvalidated with a
visual format that you had never seen
before, etc. You weren't using data, you
were using your gut. Using data makes it
much easier to win faster because humans
cannot outrun their psychology. They
tend to behave the same way over and
over. If the research is saying one Lego
brick works best for your niche in a
certain way, it's probably going to keep
working well in that way over and over.
Now, am I saying you shouldn't ever try
to be creative and experiment with
something that's never been done? No, of
course not. You should. But just know
your hit rate is going to be way lower.
If you make 10 reps based on validated
data, you're going to get more winners
than 10 reps based on your gut. It's
just a fact. So, if you want to grow
faster on social media, trust me, you
need an idea research process based on
finding outliers in your niche. Okay, so
far we've covered two of the three steps
in the idea mining system. First, you
need to look for outliers in your niche.
And second, once you find those
outliers, you need to figure out what
those seven idea Lego bricks were for
that video. What is the topic? What is
the format? How was the hook made?
You're looking for patterns that signal
what is already working. Now, here's the
third and final step. Once you identify
winning patterns in the idea Lego
bricks, you want to hold the winning
components constant and remix the rest.
So, for example, let's say we make
fitness content and we notice that all
the best performing videos are hooking
in the same way and using the same
couple visual formats. We'll take those
two components, keep them the same, but
then we will change the topic, the
angle, the story structure, the key
visuals, the audio. So, in this case,
it's hold two remix 5. I like to think
of this process kind of like playing
five card poker. You see some reference
outlier, you break it into seven cards.
You pick which cards to keep and then
you reshuffle the rest to get a new set
of seven. This makes a new combination
which has a higher chance of
outperforming the original cuz you kept
the good parts and you fix the bad. Now,
this process I just described, it's
called idea mining, and it's the most
important step in the entire content
workflow. Ideas are the thing that
differentiate the winners and losers on
social media and YouTube. This mining
process is what all the top creators and
brands are doing, and it's why they have
an edge over you. They're using the data
to tell them where the fish are. Now,
not to rain on the parade, but here is
what makes this idea research process so
difficult. The patterns for what works
in each Lego brick changes over time.
And the winning combination is
completely different from niche to
niche. What works for the fitness niche
won't always work for the makeup niche,
which is not always going to work for
the marketing niche, and so on. For some
niches, certain hook styles always work.
For other niches, certain formats always
work. For other niches, it's not clear
what the pattern is. There is no
one-izefits-all strategy that applies to
all businesses across every niche. It is
a completely blank slate from category
to category. That's why learning how to
do this idea research process is so
critical. It's probably the most
valuable content skill you could
develop. In fact, it's so valuable that
if you train yourself on becoming really
good at this, you could probably start a
sevenfigure revenue per year solo agency
where you just did this for top creators
and brands. Because regardless of the
niche, if you get good at identifying
the patterns, you can't lose. Okay, so
now that we're clear on what a video
idea actually is and the three-step
strategy for how to build an idea mining
system, let's get tactical because what
kind of channel would this be if I
didn't also just give you the stepbystep
click forclick exact tactical process
for how to do what I just described. So,
let's dive into it. First, I'm going to
explain exactly where to find the best
outlier ideas for your niche. Then I'm
going to share my screen and I'm going
to show you exactly how I run this idea
mining process a hundred times faster
than everybody else. Okay, so first
where do we find outlier videos? There
are four main places you can look for
outlier ideas. We've got a 2x2 matrix.
Let's say you make Instagram reels about
fitness content. So that means you
create short form videos on Instagram.
Short form videos is the content type.
Instagram is the content platform. Now
your goal is to find outliers of fitness
content that you can study to make
better Instagram reels. Keep that in
mind. So you could look for outliers in
four places. Same type, same platform
would be other fitness related short
form videos on Instagram. That's what
you're making and where you are. Same
same type, different platform would be
other fitness related short form videos
but on Tik Tok, YouTube, LinkedIn,
Facebook, any other platform except for
Instagram. Now different type same
platform would be other fitness related
posts on Instagram but it'd be static
images or stories. Anything except for
short form video. And then lastly,
different type, different platform would
be other fitness related posts, but
maybe it's tweets or blogs or YouTube
videos. It's non-short form video and
it's non- Instagram. Now, of those four
boxes, which places do you think are
going to be the best source of
continuous inspiration that you can use
for fitness related short form IG reels?
Two of these boxes are the golden geese
for where you should look. Pause the
video and think about it for a sec.
Okay, I'm going to tell you the answer.
It's the top two boxes. same content
type and either on the same platform or
different platforms. That's where you
should look for outlier ideas. And this
is going to be the rule. The best place
to look for outlier ideas is going to be
the same content type, in this case,
short form video, and either the same
platform, Instagram reels, or other
platforms that support that content
type, Tik Tok, YouTube, etc. And why is
this? Because humans tend to behave the
same over and over. Like I said, they
cannot outrun their psychology. Vertical
video content hits people differently
than other types of content. The
consumption patterns are just different
type to type. So the easiest foolproof
path to find winning outliers is to hold
the type constant. Find other fitness
related short form videos wherever you
can and mine them for patterns. Now if
you really know what you're doing with
content, you can find interesting idea
seeds on other content types, tweets,
blogs, YouTube. But if you do this and
find the topic and even the angle,
you're then playing from scratch on all
the other LEGO bricks. The hook won't
carry over, the story structure won't
carry over, the format won't carry over,
etc. These will not be onetoone from a
tweet to a video, and so you won't be
able to just transport it. You're gonna
have to crack the full code on your own.
This is very hard for people to do
consistently unless they're experts at
content. So, if you want the easy path,
the easiest mode, the path that all
these brands are doing, just look for
the same content type either on the same
platform or different platforms. Because
the goal when you're making content,
especially as a business or business
owner, is to derisk your effort. Every
rep, you want the highest chance that
your effort is actually going to pay
off, that the video is actually going to
work. If you want to increase your odds
significantly, just narrow your research
focus to the things that are already
working in the same format that you're
making. Okay. Now, before I get to the
real sauce and break down my process for
doing this 100 times faster, let's just
recap on where we've been so far, just
to set the table. Everyone can be even.
First, we broke down that every video
idea is really seven different idea Lego
bricks. Next, we explained that the way
to figure out what the winning patterns
are across those seven Lego bricks is to
find outliers in your niche and analyze
them. We then established that the best
place to find those outlier videos in
your niche are either on the same or
different platforms using the same
content type. So, in this era, short
form video is king for social media. If
you want to grow on social media, you
got to be making short form video. And
that means you should be looking for
outliers on Instagram, Tik Tok, and
YouTube. Okay, so at this point we're
clear. We need to look for outliers on
those platforms. So now the big question
is what is the actual process for doing
this outlier research because you can't
really expect to just scroll the feed
for 2 hours and outliers will come to
you, right? Well, the crazy thing is
yes, that is the process that everyone
has been running this whole time. They
either curate their feed to try to have
those outliers serve up automatically or
they have a list of inspiration accounts
that they manually open, scroll through
and try to find the outliers. That
process takes forever. The good news is
I have a much better way. Basically, a
shortcut for all that manual work that
makes it a hundred times faster. And
that shortcut is using Sandcastles.ai.
Sand Castles is the only tool in the
world that makes this idea mining
process extremely easy. And by the way,
if you tried the original version of
Sandcastles that was just for script
writing, this is a completely different
thing. Here's how Sand Castles works and
why it's so cracked for idea mining.
First, you build a watch list of the top
channels in your niche. And this is so
you can narrow in your outlier search to
just the accounts that you already know
are crushing. In Sandcastles, you can
use the channels tab to search for any
creator. Just drop in their handle or
their URL of their profile. And you can
add any account from Instagram, Tik Tok,
or YouTube. Now, there are thousands of
creators already in Sandcastle, and
those are going to pop up immediately.
But if we don't have somebody you want,
just search for their handle, press add
new channel, and we'll get them in there
in 15 minutes. Now, there's no limit on
the amount of channels you can add or
the amount of lists you can make. So,
you basically have unlimited power. What
you want to do is build out a list for
your core niche. And then if you want,
you can build out separate lists for
adjacent niches. So if you make fitness
content, make a watch list, name it
fitness, and add 20 to 30 of the top
fitness creators that you know are
already crushing. Now, here's a very
common question. How do I figure out
which channels I should be looking at
for inspiration? I understand how to do
it in Sand Castles, but how do I
actually know which ones to add in the
first place? And this is a great
question. There are four ways to find
the best inspiration channels when
you're doing outlier research. The first
way is that you already have a list of
accounts either in some Excel or some
list that you know make the best content
for your space. And if you have that
list, problem is obviously solved. Just
start adding that list in. The second
way is you might not have a full list,
but there's probably at least one person
that you can think of that really makes
amazing content for your space. Start
with that person. Open their account up
on Instagram and Tik Tok. Click who
they're following. And then you can see
a list of the people that they follow.
Typically, if someone is legit in a
space, they're also following the other
legit people in a space. So, that
shortens the list. Go through that list.
Anyone that's relevant, copy their
profile link, add them to Sandcastles.
The third way is to search on Instagram,
Tik Tok, or YouTube. Search for topics
or keywords that will be relevant for
your niche. When you do that, the top
videos will surface. Click on the video,
see the creator, click them, add them to
Sandcastles, and then you can start with
them and run path two that I just
mentioned. Go to who they're following
and look through that list. And the last
way to find relevant accounts to add to
watch list in Sandcastles is go to the
video tab in Sandcastles. Clear all the
filters and then search by topic or
keyword. Our database is all the top
creators across every niche. So the
videos that show, click on the creator
who made them and add that person to a
list. So there are four ways right there
to find the top accounts in your niche
to then add to a watch list in
Sandcastles. Regardless of the path you
take, all roads lead to curating a list
of the top accounts in your space. Take
the 10 to 15 minutes and do this. It'll
make everything so much easier. All
right, now is where things get really
interesting. Once you have that watch
list built out, go to the videos tab and
filter the videos for just that watch
list. What you then have is a feed of
videos posted only from the accounts in
your list. And if the hair on the back
of your neck is not standing up as you
see this, it should be because this is
an absolute cheat code for finding
outlier videos. You can take this
database of videos and now you can sort
by outlier score or posted date and
filter by a bunch of different key
metrics. So, for example, let's say I
wanted to make content about social
media marketing. Maybe I run a social
media agency or I'm trying to build a
personal brand around content marketing.
Here's the list that I've already made
with the top 20 channels that talk about
this stuff on Instagram and Tik Tok.
I've already built it out. So, I go to
the videos tab. I filter by that list.
Now, if I want to see the best
performing videos in the social media
marketing space posted in the last 3
months from my list, sorted best to
worst. Boom. There it is. And this is
basically all the outliers you need
served up on a silver platter. It is
insane how easy Sand Castles makes this
compared to the manual way everybody was
doing it. Now you can analyze these
videos in this card view so you can see
the thumbnail or in like a table view a
little bit more minimal if that's what
you prefer. If you want to just copy my
filter settings these are the best
settings for making sure the outliers
are relevant every single time. First
for outlier score you want to filter 5x
and above. For engagement rate you want
to go 5% and above. This will screen out
all the paid brand deals that are juiced
but actually not outliers. For post
date, you want to play with 7 days, 14
days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 12.
If you're making news-based content
where relevancy and recency matters, 7
days, 14 days is the best. If you make
evergreen content, 3 months, 6 months,
even 12 months might surface interesting
ideas that are still relevant. And then
you want to sort using those two arrows
in the upper right by outlier score
descending. That's the easiest way to
get the top performing videos at the
top. And you can create a filter preset
with all these. Just press that save
button. It'll save a preset for you. So
you can one click get this every single
time. Now obviously new videos are being
posted by these creators every single
day and we're ingesting them daily. So
you really want to be in sand castles
every day or at least four to five times
a week so you're constantly seeing the
latest outliers. Now from here the
process is to start analyzing those
individual outlier videos across the
seven idea Lego bricks. And you can do
that in two different ways. The first
way is you can just click play video on
any of the cards or the row and it will
open the video up so you can just watch
it manually. The second way is that you
can click into each video and see the
idea detail page. And here you get a
bunch of metrics on the video, the full
transcript, as well as detailed analysis
on the hook structure and the story
structure. Now, here's my personal
process for how I go about using this. I
like to use both of those methods
combined. So, first I will open the
video and watch it manually. Then I'll
go to the idea detail page and I will
look at the transcript and those
structures. And again, the goal and the
reason I'm doing this is that I'm trying
to mine for patterns across those seven
idea Lego bricks so that I know what
works in my space. Okay, so when I'm
analyzing each video and I'm going
through this mining process, what am I
actually looking for with respect to the
Lego bricks? I like to go about this in
two ways as well. The first category is
daily inspiration. And really what I'm
looking for here are specific topics,
angles, and key visuals that are
interesting to me that might be a topic
I want to make soon. And I'm doing this
daily to find these daily inspiring
pieces. And then on the other side, I've
got more long-term monthly and weekly
tracking that I'm doing. Hook structure,
story structure, visual format. You may
not see a common pattern across visual
formats in just 20 videos on one day.
But holistically, if I do this every day
for a week, am I starting to see the
same story structure? That's more of
long-term. So, I'm doing like real time,
daily, and long-term at the same time
when I mine. So, for me, I like to open
a Google doc and I set it up like this.
At the top of the page, I've got daily
inspiration. Each bullet is a topic. And
so, if I see a video I like and the
topic is interesting, I'll grab that
video and I'll write the following
topics, angles, anything about the hook
that popped out to me, key visuals. I
also drop the link for that video there
so I have it to reference. And then any
audio notes about this video. So, it's
all me analyzing this one video, not an
aggregate pattern. It's this one
specific video. Was it interesting to
me? And what did I like about it? Then
below in a separate section on the page,
I have more of these long-term patterns
that I'm trying to monitor over time.
And so I've got hook structures, series
structures, and visual formats. Anytime
I start to have an idea pop in my head
about a trend across any of those three
that I'm starting to notice, I write it
down. And to click down even one step
further, this is literally what I do. I
open the video and I watch it. The first
filter is this. Do I find this topic
interesting or is it kind of dumb and
not relevant to me? Because obviously,
you're not going to remake a video if
you think it's dumb and interesting.
That's like the first dumb filter.
Anything that doesn't pass through, I
just skip it and ignore it. Right? So,
we get past that first. Now, after I get
past that kind of like dumb check
filter, and I do see a video that
inspires me, I'm going to open the dock.
I'm going to add that new bullet for a
topic. And I'm going to write all those
things down. Am I interested about this?
What did they say? What were their
certain lines they said that piqu my
interest? Were there visuals they use?
Are there gaps that I'm seeing that
could be potentially filled? Did they
use certain audio that drove emotion?
I'm just writing notes down about the
effectiveness of this video. Because the
truth is, if I'm looking at it using
sand castles, this is an outlier. So,
they did something that worked. What was
it that worked? I'm trying to figure
that out. And I'm using this doc
bucketing it by Lego brick because I'm
trying to figure out where are the weak
points. What did they do well? But then
what didn't they do well that if I remix
I can beat. After going through 20 to 30
videos in a single session, I will have
a list of ideas, topics that I liked
that are also validated by the market.
And my goal, like I said, is to analyze
those seven Lego bricks of the outlier,
figure out what they did really well
that I want to keep constant and what
they didn't do well that I could improve
on. Now, typically for me, what I've
noticed is I will almost always change
the angle, the hook, and the visual
format. But usually, I will leave the
topic, some of the key visuals, and
usually like the audio mood of it. But
this is all an iterative process. It
changes topic to topic. It changes niche
to niche. The point is, you know, how to
pull the winners and look for why they
won and where there are weak spots. Now,
if you guys want, I can make another
video in the future that's just a screen
share live session for an hour of me in
sand castles doing this, like voicing
over the process. What am I seeing for
every single video? Why am I pulling it?
I can do that for you. We don't have
enough time to go through deep examples
in this video, but if you want that,
comment below and I'll know to make that
video. Okay, so that really is the easy
mode process of how to do idea mining in
a nutshell. You're going to use sand
castle.ai to create a list of the top
creators in your niche. You're going to
use that to aggregate the best
performing videos in one place. And then
you're going to analyze them one by one.
And when you watch each video, you're
going to look for insight across every
Lego brick. What was the topic? What was
their take, premise, or angle? What was
the hook they used and how was it
executed? How did they structure the
story? What was the visual layout or
visual format? Were there compelling key
visuals they used or not? What was the
audio and did it emotionally drive you
to the feeling that you thought was
compelling? Based on those answers,
you're going to assess where the white
space is. What was weak about that
outlier that you could improve on to
make an even better version. And the
best part about using sand castles for
this process is that there's no noise.
You're only seeing the best performing
videos in your space. So, that helps you
see the patterns way faster. Okay. Now,
after this, what comes next? What comes
next is being able to take those raw
Lego bricks and reassemble them into new
combinations for your version of the
video. And that's where you really
figure out which parts to hold, which
parts to remix, how to combine all that
and write a new script, and so on. And
this is the second piece of the idea
process. It's called idea development.
First, you mine for the winners, analyze
them, and break it apart into pieces.
Then, you reassemble those pieces in a
new way to make a better video. Now, I
don't have enough time in this video to
cover the whole idea development process
because that's another piece in itself,
but so you know, when I do the idea
development, I've got a full hook
database. I've got a full story
structure database. I have a full
database of the visual formats. I'm
looking at the winners. I'm holding
pieces constant. I'm going to my
database, swapping in new pieces. That's
how I'm doing the development in real
time. Now, if you guys want me to make
that idea development video, kind of
like part two to ideas where I take one
of these outliers from the mining, break
it down, and then rebuild it, you need
to drop in the comments as well to let
me know that's what you want. Just say
something like, "Give me the sauce
chef." And I'll know exactly what that
means. Also, by the way, to thank you
guys for the support on this channel,
anybody watching the video at this
point, I'm giving you the biggest
discount code on sand castles that
exists on the internet. It's code
callaway. Use that at checkout. I'm not
going to have it up forever, so make
sure you use it now. All right, guys.
That is all I've got for this video. As
a recap, we covered a ton of ground.
This one really was a tactical banger on
ideas, and this was the first time I
covered ideas on this channel in a
meaningful way. So, make sure to let me
know what you thought of this one in the
comments. Here's a summary of what we
went over. First, we broke down the
seven core pieces that make up a video
idea. We call those idea Lego bricks.
And those were the topic, the angle, the
hook structure, the story structure, the
visual format, the key visuals, and the
audio. Then we broke down the three-step
process for how to build an idea mining
system and introduced the concept of an
outlier. After that, we explored the
four options of places to look for
outliers and the two best ones, the same
content type across the same or
different platforms. From there, I went
kind of super saiyan, breaking down the
exact tactical process for how to use
that idea mining system with sand
castles.ai to find and mine for
patterns. We also broke down the exact
process for how to build your idea short
list, that dock that you capture
patterns on. This should be everything
you need to go from zero to having an
idea mining system in place that
actually crushes no matter what your
niche is. From here, the next piece in
the process is idea development, where
you take those winning idea Lego brick
patterns and build them up to make your
own version. And again, I'll make that
video for you guys as long as you
comment, give me the sauce chef below.
As always guys, I'm trying my absolute
best to actually give you the sauce, the
