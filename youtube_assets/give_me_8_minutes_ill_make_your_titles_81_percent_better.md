## Transcript

if just 5 to 10 words determine the success 
of your next video you'd want to get them  
right and yet I see so many YouTubers sabotage 
themselves with bad titles it happens all the  
time they'll spend days working on a video and 
hours perfecting a thumbnail only to treat the  
title as a mere afterthought but your title is 
doing way more heavy lifting than you realize  
to the point where a single title change can 
be enough to blow up a video so in the next  
8 minutes I'm breaking down the five biggest 
mistakes YouTubers make with their titles and  
how to fix them we'll start off with by far the 
most common title mistake that I see which is  
not giving people a reason to click because here's 
the brutal truth if people aren't clicking on your  
video it's because you're not generating enough 
curiosity take this video from Anthony Chen where  
he tries out different Filipino foods most people 
will title this video something along the lines of  
I tried Filipino food but look at what Anthony 
did instead I flew 7,292 Mi to eat here which  
title makes you more Curious the second one why 
because it makes you ask questions why did you  
fly so far to eat there what kind of food do they 
serve was it worth it these questions open a loop  
and our brains hate unfinished thoughts so we're 
driven to click on the video to learn the answer  
if no one's clicking on your video it's because 
your title doesn't open a strong enough Loop how  
do you open stronger Loops well a lot of ways I'll 
put some up on screen to help you get started but  
this actually leads quite nicely into into title 
mistake number two which is not using what already  
been proven to work because you don't have to 
invent brand new ways of generating curiosity  
even the most successful YouTubers in the world 
don't pull titles out of thin err instead they  
model proven formats taking inspiration from 
titles that have already driven millions of  
views for either themselves or for others how do 
you do that well start by identifying outliers or  
videos that have far outperformed a Channel's view 
average you can find these outliers by scrolling  
through different creators video libraries and 
looking for uploads with significantly higher  
views than their surrounding videos but to make it 
easier I like using an outlier tool like spotter  
Studio especially when it comes to finding 
outliers within my own Niche spotter studio is  
also the sponsor of this video but more on them 
later after you find an outlier break the title  
down into its core underlying structure take this 
video from cold kwin this title can be broken down  
into the format I took bold action for time frame 
this is what happened happened you can then apply  
that format to your own video I woke up at 400 
a.m. every day for a month this is what happened  
I tried five passive income streams for year this 
is what happened you get the idea so before you  
write a title look for what's already working take 
the structure and make it your own mistake number  
three is using boring words in your title just 
one word or phrase could be the difference between  
your title getting clicks and getting completely 
ignored take a look at these two titles from the  
same video how to edit and film YouTube videos how 
to edit and film cinematic videos like a pro the  
first title is vague and uninspiring it tells you 
what the video is about but it doesn't give you  
compelling reason to click the second with just 
a few words instantly makes the video feel more  
valuable high quality and worth watching That's 
The Power of power words specific words that make  
your title more intriguing without changing its 
meaning here are four categories of power words  
that can instantly level up a title A otal power 
words Authority power words urgency power words  
and exclusivity power words but here's the real 
secret every Niche has its own power words that  
are particularly effective in driving Clicks 
in the finance Niche you'll often see words  
like broke millionaire and passive income in the 
fitness Niche you'll see shredded transformation  
and fat burning to find yours scroll through the 
top performing videos in your Niche and look for  
patterns you'll start seeing the same words 
over and over again and if you want to cheat  
Studios power up feature can instantly generate 
titles using Niche specific power words for you  
using data from over 30 million views to identify 
words or phrases that have outperformed within  
your Niche if you find a title you like spotter 
Studio makes it incredibly easy to continue the  
ideation process you can use the rephrase feature 
to rewrite your title in creative ways the shorten  
feature to simplify it or if you're looking for a 
complete refresh the explode feature reframes or  
title using different techniques and angles to try 
out those and countless other features features

so so much to spotter studio for sponsoring this 
video mistake number four is being too wordy in  
your titles it's important to remember that your 
title isn't viewed in a vacuum it's surrounded  
by dozens of other videos each competing for 
attention and if your title takes long to process  
your viewer's eyes will instantly be drawn to a 
title with a faster intake speed I'll show you  
what I mean take a look at these two titles which 
one is your ey drawn to for most people it's this  
one simply because it's easier to read ideally you 
want to keep your title under 55 characters but  
longer titles can work as long as you structure 
them effectively word order in YouTube matters  
because people don't read word for word they skim 
compare these two variations of the same title in  
the first variation someone's skimming might not 
even realize what the video is about and on some  
devices YouTube will cut off a second half with a 
dot dot dot leaving out the most curiosity evoking  
part frontload the most important words of your 
title and make sure that the core message of your  
title is clear even as someone who only catches 
the first half and finally title mistake number  
five is sticking with a title that's not working 
sometimes despite your best efforts a title just  
doesn't perform and that's okay but you need 
to be willing to change it big creators do this  
all the time and I mean all the time how do you 
know if a title needs to be changed monitor your  
click-through rate or CTR and your impressions 
if they're both lower than average in the first  
24 hours there's something about your title and 
thumbnail that's not resonating which variable  
you change is up to you but it's much easier 
to make a title change than it is to make a  
thumbnail change if your CTR and impressions are 
average hold off on changing anything until after  
the window where your videos typically start 
gaining traction for some channels that's 2  
days after upload for others it can take up to a 
week or more my own videos tend to start picking  
up around day 8 to 10 so I hold off on making any 
major changes until after that if you're not sure  
what your own pattern is go into YouTube Studio 
check the gray typical in this period view range  
and look for where it changes slope you won't 
always see an immediate impact after changing  
a title sometimes it can take up to a week or 
more to see results but either way it's worth  
doing because sometimes all your video needs to 
blow up is the right title and look if you're  
watching this video and realizing that you are 
making one or more of these title mistakes that's  
great because that means that you're showing up 
you're seeking out ways to improve and you're  
making the effort to learn this whole YouTube 
thing is hard the deeper you go and the more  
videos that you watch the more you realize just 
how much there is to get better at but you don't  
have to make all the changes all at once pick one 
mistake to correct one micro adjustment to make it  
a time and one day you'll look back and realize 
just how far you've come if you like this video  
and want to continue your YouTube educational 
journey I would highly recommend checking out

a killer YouTube thumbnail otherwise thank you so
