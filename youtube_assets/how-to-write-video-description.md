What if fine-tuning custom OpenAI models was as simple as uploading a file and clicking a button? In this comprehensive 26-minute guide, I break down exactly how to fine-tune powerful custom models with zero coding skills required. You'll discover two easy-to-follow methods: the first lets you instantly generate your training data using ChatGPT and directly fine-tune your model in the OpenAI Playground; the second gives you full visibility by integrating Airtable with n8n to track your fine-tuning progress in real-time and run automated tests comparing outputs. I’ll also demystify key fine-tuning concepts like JSONL formatting, epochs, batch sizes, and learning rate multipliers in a clear, beginner-friendly way—empowering you to quickly craft models that reflect your unique brand voice or business use case.

Now here’s exactly what you need to do:

Using the above example as a guideline, now write a similar quality video description with the following customizable fields:

Customizable Fields:

[Main Topic]: Clearly state the main topic covered by the video.
(e.g., "Fine-tuning custom OpenAI models easily with ChatGPT and Airtable.")

[Video Length]: Clearly indicate the length of the video.
(e.g., "26-minute guide")

[Key Benefits or Outcomes]: Highlight the clear, valuable outcomes viewers will gain from watching.
(e.g., "quickly craft models that reflect your unique brand voice or business use case")

[Tools or Techniques Covered]: Clearly mention the specific tools, platforms, or techniques covered in the video.
(e.g., "ChatGPT, Airtable, JSONL formatting, epochs, batch sizes, learning rate multipliers, OpenAI Playground, n8n")

[Timestamp Sections]: Clearly provide structured timestamps (MM:SS format) for every major segment in your video, ensuring it spans the entire video length. Each timestamp should have a concise but descriptive segment title.
(e.g., "00:00 – Intro: Fine-tuning OpenAI Models Easily")

[SEO-friendly Hashtags]: Clearly list 10-15 hashtags highly optimized for YouTube discoverability.
(e.g., "#FineTuning, #ChatGPT, #OpenAI, #n8n, #Airtable")

Use the provided video transcript to carefully identify and include all major segments and ensure the timestamps are accurate and comprehensive. Your final output must exactly match the formatting provided in the example above.

Order:

1. URLs
