Social media is just one giant game. And
if you want to grow faster, there's
really only one thing you need to
master, game theory. Now, game theory is
understanding the reasons why different
players make decisions in a game.
Because the truth is, social media and
YouTube are just one giant game of
attention. So, if you can deeply
understand why certain players act
certain ways, you can build a content
strategy that runs laps around all of
them. And I know this works because all
I do all day long is figure out ways to
grow faster on social media and YouTube.
I have a million followers. I've done
billions of views. And all that traction
came from studying game theory. So, in
this video, I'm going to break that
whole framework down. This is the
four-step playbook for how to actually
understand social media game theory and
use it to your advantage. And I promise
you this will open your eyes to a whole
new way of looking at the content game.
Okay. Now, before we go through the
four-step playbook, let's just quickly
align on what game theory actually is,
because you've probably heard that term,
but may not have applied it to a concept
in your own life or business. Now, all
game theory is is analyzing and
predicting how different people will act
in a game. And here's why that game
theory concept is so helpful for us. It
turns out if you analyze the content
game, social media and YouTube, you can
apply those same game theory principles
to figure out the optimal strategy. And
all this really is is deeply
understanding psychology and incentives.
Like I said before, this one thing is
the secret to how I've grown so fast on
social media and YouTube. And so in this
video, I'm just going to break the whole
thing down and give it to you cuz I want
to see you grow fast, too. Okay. Now,
here are the four parts to the game
theory framework that we're going to
walk through in this video. The players,
the incentives, the games, and the
strategies. That's what's coming up.
Okay. Now, part one of the social media
game theory playbook is understanding
the players. We can't figure out how the
players are going to act unless we know
who they are. So, in addition to you,
there are six other main groups of
players playing in the content game.
First, we have the social platforms as
represented by the algorithm. Second, we
have the viewers, but there's actually
two different types of viewers that
behave very differently. Passive viewers
and active viewers. For passive viewers,
we'll consider these as viewers that do
not have pain points relative to your
topic niche. These are non buyers. They
would never buy your stuff. They're just
watchers of the content because they're
interested in the topic. On the other
side, we have active viewers who are
potential buyers and do have pain points
related to your topic niche. And this
will help illustrate the difference. For
example, if you make content about
marketing for business owners, a junior
staff marketer might be a passive viewer
because they're not really in a buying
position, but they're still interested
in marketing as a topic. An entrepreneur
running an agency is an active viewer
because they are in a buying position
and have those pain points. Now, all
viewers on social media can be both
passive and active viewers in different
niches at the same time. It just depends
on where they actually have pain points.
For example, I am a passive viewer of
sports content, but I'm an active viewer
of social media marketing content cuz
that's where I have my business. Okay,
so so far those are three of the
players, the algorithms, the passive
viewers, and the active viewers. Who
else do we have? Third, we have other
creators. And the other creators can
also be split up into two subgroups.
Entertainment creators and education
creators. And here's the difference.
Entertainment creators are trying to
entertain a mass audience in their
category. They do not have a bottom of
the funnel offer. So they monetize
through CPMs like Tik Tok creator fund
and YouTube AdSense program and brand
deals. Now education creators on the
other hand, they want specific views
from within their buyer demographic.
They're not going for mass reach.
They're going for specific views from a
specific audience. They do have a bottom
ofunnel offer and are solely focused on
conversion from the social platforms to
that offer. They may also get some
income from CPM and brand deals, but it
is not a primary focus for them. Okay,
so we've got other entertainment
creators and other education creators in
your category. That makes up four and
five. And then last, we have the brands
and advertisers. And in this case, the
brands and advertisers are considered
the people from the outside that pay
creators for brand deals, not the brand
accounts that make their own content.
Okay? So those are the seven players in
the content game. Whether you're on
social media or YouTube, there's you,
the algorithm, passive viewers, active
viewers, other entertainment creators in
your category, other education creators
in your category, and the brands and
advertisers. And we needed to start
there because it's impossible to figure
out who's going to act in what way
unless we know who's actually playing.
Okay, so now question two is how do we
predict how each of those players is
going to act in the social media arena?
Cuz if we know how they'll act and it's
predictable, we can just build out a
content strategy that takes advantage of
those actions. And if you've never
thought like this, this is some Jedi
mind voodoo, but I promise you it will
really make sense in a second. The way
to figure out how other players are
going to act is to figure out what they
want most. And the way to figure out
what they want most is to deeply
understand their incentives and base
psychology. Now, machine-based players
in the game, the algorithm, are actually
way more predictable than humans because
the algorithm is essentially just math
at scale. If you know what the algorithm
wants and it's mathematically designed
to get it, if you just give that more of
it over and over, it will push you and
give you what you want. But human player
incentives, everybody else, are a little
bit harder to figure out because humans
don't always act rationally. But don't
worry, no human can outrun their base
psychology. So, we can solve this as
well. Okay, so as a recap so far, in
order to win the social media game, all
we have to do is analyze the psychology
and incentives of all the other players
and then reverse engineer what content
we can make to give them more of those
incentives. If viewing our content helps
them get more of what they want most,
they're going to push it for us. And
this is the playbook that I'm about to
explain. Stay with me. I promise you
this will make a ton of sense in like
three minutes. All right, we're moving
to part two in the playbook, which is
incentives. In order to figure out how
to give each player what they want, we
need to understand what it is they want.
So, let's break down the incentives for
what each different player wants most.
We can map those and then come up with a
strategy. And this process of mapping
incentives really in any area in
business is actually super helpful. So,
pay attention to this. Okay, let's start
with the incentives of social platforms
and the algorithm. What does the
algorithm actually want? The social
platforms have one job. Maximize ad
revenue. And ad revenue is directly
correlated to the number of user minutes
on the platform. The more user minutes,
the more time those users spend clicking
on ads, the more ad revenue the platform
makes. It's that simple. Now, user
minutes are calculated from two things.
The number of active users and the
number of minutes each user spends per
session. So, think about that. What the
algorithm wants is for new users to come
to the platform and start sessions and
for existing users to stay on the
platform longer and extend their current
session. So, it will push content, more
views, more shares, whatever, as long as
it helps them do those two things. new
sessions, extending existing sessions.
Now, the closest proxy metrics for your
content's ability to extend a current
user session is a combination of average
view duration, how long did someone
watch? Engagement rate, how much did
they like it enough to interact with it?
And platform bounce rate, what percent
of people watched your video and then
literally left the platform and ended
their session. The combination of those
three things is how the platforms
measure your ability to extend user
sessions. So, knowing this, our content
needs to be optimized for two things. To
drive shares and to increase average
viewer duration. Okay, put a pin in
that. Just remember, I'm going to finish
all the incentives for the players and
we're going to come back and break down
the strategy for how to actually make
content that drives those two things.
Stay tuned. Okay, next let's study the
incentives of the passive viewer. And
again, this is a passive viewer with
respect to your topic category. If I
talk about sports, I don't care about
passive viewers in cooking. I just want
passive viewers in sports. So whatever
content you make, assume that a passive
viewer is interested in that topic but
is not a potential buyer. In other
words, a passive viewer is using social
media or YouTube for entertainment. Now
the number one incentive, what the
passive viewer wants most is to feel the
dopamine hit that comes with scrolling
and keep getting that as they scroll.
Now dopamine is typically released as a
result of two things. Emotional
response, surprise, shock, sadness, any
of the emotions, or curiosity loops,
open questions that become like a maze
in the viewer's brain. Those are the two
things. emotional response, curiosity
loops. That's what drives dopamine for
the entertainment viewer. And we will
come back to how to engineer this as
well in a second. Let's just go to the
next one. Okay. Next, we have active
viewers. Again, these are viewers with
pain points in your niche category that
are also potential buyers. Now, active
viewers behave differently than passive
viewers. An active viewer is using
social media to find tactical solutions
to their problems. And so their number
one incentive, what they want most from
the content is to find an answer that is
tactically implementable as quickly as
possible where they can feel relief from
a pain point they currently face. Okay,
next we have other entertainment
creators. And again, I'm going to go
through all the players, all the
incentives, map everything, and then
figure out the winning strategy at the
end. I promise you it's worth it because
I know what the strategy is and it
works. Okay. Okay, now as a reminder,
other entertainment creators are using
social media to try to get as many views
as possible in their category. These are
people that do not have a back-end
offer. They do not have a funnel. They
do not have products and services to
sell. They are the product and the ad
revenue that they get from either brand
deals or CPMs is how they monetize. So,
for an entertainment creator, what they
want most is to maximize view-based
revenue. And the way they do that is to
grow their following or subscribers as
much as possible, have the highest
possible average views, and have the
highest possible average engagement. All
right, next up, we have other education
creators in your category. And again, an
education creator is using social media
to drive as many conversions as
possible. These are people that do have
a back-end offer and they have products
at the bottom of the funnel. Their main
goal is to use social media as a ramp to
get people from rented platforms into
owned platforms like email list,
community, and paid products. For
education creators, what they're looking
for is to maximize ontarget views, which
is the highest possible penetration in
their category set with the most free
push from the algorithm. Their primary
incentive is to figure out how to make
content that gets pushed as hard as
possible via the algorithm, but just
within their target segment. So, for an
education creator, what they really want
most is the consistent delivery of leads
from social media into their owned
products. Okay. And lastly, we have the
brands and advertisers. And these are
people that don't actively make content,
but they still play a big role in the
ecosystem. Again, when we refer to
brands here, we're talking about the act
of them paying entertainment creators
for brand deals, not them making
content. So for brands, the thing they
want most is the maximum return on ad
spend. And the best way to measure this
are direct links on sponsored posts and
the conversion rate of those links.
Okay, so that's a summary of the players
and the incentives each of them have in
the social media game. The algorithms
want more user minutes. The passive
viewer wants more entertainment via
dopamine release. The active viewer
wants tactical solutions to their
problems faster and easier. The
entertainment creator wants more ad
revenue, either CPMs or brand deals. The
education creator wants higher
conversion rates off platform. And the
brands want a higher return on ad spend
from the entertainment creators that
they sponsor. These are what I call the
peak incentives. If you boil everything
down, each one of those players wants
that thing. So, here's how it all comes
together. If we can make content that
gives those players those things, they
will push our content more to get more
of those things. So, let's keep going.
The next question is, how do we adjust
our content strategy? How do we figure
out what content to make to give them
more of those things? And before we
drill down on that, the content
strategy, which is what everybody wants,
that's part four. We just need to go
through one more thing, which is part
three. And that is which game are we
actually playing? Which game are we
building the right strategy for? Because
based on the game you're playing, you're
actually going to pay attention to
different of those players and make
different moves. It turns out social
media is actually two giant games meshed
into one. The awareness game and the
conversion game. Now, you can make nine
figures annually playing either game,
but you need to pick one over the other
per channel because the strategies vary
significantly. And I know there are two
games because I've been playing both
games in different places. I've played
the entertainment game on social media
with my tech content. And I've played
the education game on this channel on
YouTube with my short form, long- form
content, strategy content. You can only
play one game per channel, but you can
play both games at the same time if you
have multiple channels. Now, because
I've played both and won both, I can
break down the strategy optimal game
theory moves for each game and
specifically which players matter in
each game and how to change your
strategy to take advantage regardless of
which one you're playing. Again, one
more point here before I dive into all
the answers. You can probably understand
a that I am a complete nerd when it
comes to this stuff. I love psychology
more than anything, which is why I made
this channel and why I'm trying to help
you guys win. This whole thing is just
breaking down psychology and then
building up a strategy to take
advantage. And the second thing is I
approach this content game like a
scientist and a psychologist, not like
an artist. And I know there might be
some people watching this that really
think of content as an art expression
and might think of the way I talk about
this as icky or whatever word you want
to use. I apologize to you. you probably
don't want to watch the rest of this
video cuz I'm going to break down an
exact formula and a science for how to
win. Apologies. Okay, here are the two
differences between the two different
games. The awareness game and the
conversion game. The awareness game is
the top of the funnel media game. In
this game, you're going for max views at
all costs in your category because
you're getting paid per 1,000
impressions. Either literally per 10,000
impressions by CPMs, Tik Tok and YouTube
AdSense, or as a proxy of a,000
impressions via brand deals. In the
awareness game, the players you care
about are the algorithm, passive
viewers, other entertainment creators,
and the brands. The other players,
active viewers, and education creators
in your space, you don't care about.
They're just netneutral to you. They
don't sway your strategy. Now, because
you're looking for max views, your goal,
what you want out of this game is the
following. You want the algorithm to
push your videos to as many passive
viewers as possible. You want to get
more views than the other entertainment
creators you're competing with in the
space and you want brands to pay you the
most for brand deals. That's what you're
after if you're playing the awareness
game as an entertainment creator. And
again, most traditional media companies
are playing the awareness game and
they're making 8 to9 figures per year.
Thousands of individual creators will
make millions per year on their own
playing the awareness game. So, it's not
a bad or evil game. This game can crush.
You just have to decide, is this the
game you want to play? Now, the other
game is the conversion game. And this is
the middle and bottom off ofunnel media
game. In this game, you're going for max
ontarget views because you're making
money. You're getting paid based on how
well your viewers convert into the
products and offers you have at the
bottom of the funnel. You might also be
getting paid CPMs or light brand deals,
but this is icing. That's not your
primary incentive. Now, in the
conversion game, the only players you
care about are the algorithm, active
viewers, and then both other
entertainment and other education
creators in your space. And I'll explain
why both. In the conversion game, you do
not care about passive viewers in your
category or the brands and advertisers.
They may pay you, but that's really not
what you're building for. So, you can
see there are different player groups
that matter for different games
depending on which one you're playing.
Okay. Now, part four in this whole
video, part four in the playbook, which
is what everybody wants, is where I'm
going to break down the specific
strategy for how you make certain
content to win each game. What type of
content should you make to win the
awareness game? What type of content
should you make to win the conversion
game? You can win both. You just have to
pick one per channel. Now, I'm going to
start with the awareness game, cuz
that's the order I explained it in. If
you don't care at all about the
awareness game, and you just care about
the conversion game, feel free to look
in the timeline and skip ahead, and I'll
explain the conversion game in a second.
However, if you're a nerd about this,
you probably should just watch both
because it's pretty damn interesting.
All right, here we go. This is how to
use game theory to win the awareness
game on social media or YouTube. Now,
the good news is the awareness game is
actually very simple. In this game, you
are an entertainment creator. That's who
you are. You can pick a topic that's
businessy or feels educational, but you
are an entertainment person talking
about topics, going for mass views in
whatever category you've chosen. All you
want is to get the most views possible
in a given period. And doing this will
help you maximally monetize from CPMs
and brand deals. Okay, now let's remind
ourselves quickly which players matter
for the awareness game. It's the
algorithm, it's passive viewers, it's
other entertainment creators in the
category like you, and its brands and
advertisers. Those four. Quick refresher
on what each of those four wants most. I
know I talked about that probably 10
minutes ago. Let's just bring it to the
top of our mind. First, the algorithm
wants more user minutes. And the way to
get more user minutes for the algorithm,
so it pushes you more, is to make
content that has high shares and high
average viewer duration. If our videos
have high average watch time, it's
elongating existing user sessions, which
drives user minutes up. So the algorithm
will give us more views, which is all we
care about, as long as we have high
shares and high AVD. Okay. The second
group that matters, passive viewers.
They want the dopamine release. The way
to get more dopamine for the passive
viewers is to evoke curiosity or drive
an emotional response. Now, we have
several specific tactics for how to
drive curiosity and emotions, which I'm
going to go through in a second. But the
way to measure our effectiveness at
driving those things is shares,
comments, and average view duration.
Shares and comments are a proxy for a
viewer wanting to share this emotional
experience with someone else. An average
viewer duration is a reflection of how
curious they were at watching. And at
this point, if you're paying attention,
you should say, "Hm, that's interesting.
Algorithms and passive viewers get what
they want most if we make content that
has high shares and high average viewer
duration. Interesting. Okay. The third
group that matters in this game, other
entertainment creators like us. And what
do they want? They want the same thing
we want, which is super high views so
they can monetize with max revenue. Now,
other entertainment creators are going
to make their own videos and go for
views. But we could also help them by
giving them banger content ideas that
they could make or remix or helping them
build trust with their audience so their
audience wants to watch them more. And
more on how we do that in a minute. Just
refreshing everything. Fourth, the
brands, the other player that matters,
they want high return on ad spend. If
they sponsor one of our videos, they
want to make sure it's worth the money.
And the way we get them a high return on
ad spend and high confidence is that we
have consistently high views on the
content we make. Okay, now let's think
about this. Here's where the magic comes
in. What we want is more views. The
algorithm will give us more views. If we
make content that has high shares and
high average watch time, the passive
viewer will keep watching if we make
videos that induce raw curiosity and
emotional response. The other
entertainment creators will share our
videos with their audience, driving
views up if we have such unique ideas
and concepts that it helps them build
trust as the curator. This means all you
need to do as an entertainment creator
to win the awareness game is make
content that has these four attributes.
A highly shareworthy, B frame insatiable
curiosity in the hook at the beginning,
C have a strong emotional payoff at the
end, and D appeal to as large of a total
addressable market as possible. And it
turns out these are the four most
important foolproof ingredients for
making content as an entertainment
creator that will help you win in any
niche. Now, let's click into those four
things and deeply understand how we
engineer them. I'm going all the way
down to the bare metal. You want the
tactics? Here are the tactics. Let's
start with sharability. First thing, you
want to make videos that are shareworthy
because again, if they get lots of
shares from passive viewers and other
entertainment creators in your space,
the algorithm will like that and push it
more. Okay. So, what actually drives
shares? People share things because they
believe they will get the social or
professional credit of doing so from
their friends or colleagues. Now, credit
could be a laugh, a cry, a hat tip,
admiration, building trust. Regardless
of which one it is, people share because
they want the recipient that they share
to to think positively of them in some
way. For example, if you see a funny
clip and you share it, it's because you
want the recipient to laugh, to have
that shared experience, but you also
want them to think of you as that guy
that shares the funny stuff. That's the
credit. People share because they want
the credit from the recipient of being
funny, smart, tapped in, sensitive,
whatever it is. Now, this is really
important. That credit is only shared
back to the original sharer if the
recipient hadn't seen that thing before.
Cuz if you think about it, you could
have the world's funniest joke, but when
you share it, if that person has watched
that joke five times, they're not going
to give you the credit for being the
funny curator. So for you as the
entertainment creator, if you want to
make something that's shareworthy to get
shared with a ton of people, you either
need to be first to share that topic
with that group or different enough that
when they see a new twist on a thing
they've seen before, they give that
credit back. And this psychology is
where shares actually come from. One
more really important point on shares. A
share from a normal passive viewer is
worth one. But a share from a fellow
entertainment creator, especially one
with a huge audience, is worth
thousands. I call this a super share.
The more super shares you can unlock
from other entertainment creators in
your space, the faster you will grow and
drive that viral loop. because instead
of a few hundred people being exposed on
a normal person's reshare, you're
getting tens of thousands of new eyes
because of that super share. Now, you
might think, "Oh, there's no way other
entertainment creators would share my
stuff." If they're watching this, they
want to beat me, so why would they ever
share? But this isn't true. Remember
what they want most. They want max
views. And to get max views, they need
trust from their audience that what they
post is valuable. If your video concept
is so novel and so interesting that just
by reposting it, they get some
professional credit attributed back to
them, they will do it. And if they do,
the algorithmic flywheel will explode.
So to get other entertainment creators
to super share, the bar for that idea
quality, the novelty and being first or
different is even higher than it is for
passive viewers. But if you can cross
that bar, your video will explode. Okay.
Now, the second attribute, the thing I
said is you need to make sure you frame
curiosity in the hook at the beginning
of the video. And I often refer to this
as building a curiosity loop. And all
you have to do to build a curiosity loop
is to contrast against a conventional
belief that the viewer already has. Now,
I talk about this a lot in my other
videos, especially the ones on hooks.
So, if you want to dive deeper on this,
go watch those. But, for example, if I
start a video like this, this is going
to change how accountants do their job.
If you're an accountant, you were now
extremely curious. Why? Your baseline
was I know how to do my job. But now I'm
introducing a new reality where
something happened that might change
your conventional belief. It might not
be the case now that you know how to do
your job unless you watch what this
thing is. That contrast between your
base reality and my proposed new reality
will drive curiosity. And if that's you
and you're on topic, you cannot help but
go down that rabbit hole. So, all you
have to do as the entertainment creator
is frame the hook, whether it's spoken,
written, or visual, with some
contrastdriven curiosity, and then
you've got them hooked. And again, we
need this initial curiosity loop so that
we can trigger the dopamine release for
the passive viewer so they keep watching
and we can extend average view duration.
You see how all these pieces are
starting to be connected together? Okay.
Now, the third thing your videos must
have is an emotional payoff by the end.
Again, this is for entertainment
content. If you want mass market shares,
you need an emotional payoff at the end.
And emotional payoffs are the best way
to drive these macro viral share loops.
Again, people share because they want to
get the credit of being emotionally
tapped in. They want that emotional
feeling to transfer so they get the
credit back. Now, to build this
emotional feeling in a video, you need
to use your words, your tone, the topic,
the visuals, the music to evoke some
emotion in the viewer by the end of the
video. If they don't feel that emotional
response, they're not going to share
because they won't think that there's
credit to be earned on the way back.
Now, certain topics have more emotional
charge than others. There's an infinite
rabbit hole about how to actually write
scripts and words to drive emotion. But
here's a pro tip. Typically, framing
your point against what they want most.
Another contrast piece is the way to get
them shock, fear, that kind of anger,
emotion, which will get them to share.
Okay, the last piece of the four,
remember these are the four pieces that
you need in your content if you want to
win the awareness game as an
entertainer. The last piece is that you
need your topic ideas to have a large
cam, total addressable market. The
number of total people that will be
interested in that topic is large. And
this is pretty obvious, but in order to
get more views, you need more people
that will be potentially interested in
the thing you're talking about. So, what
this really means, if you want to pick
ideas that have a broad tam, you either
need to pick simple topics that lots of
people can understand or embed
references in those topics that massive
amounts of people can relate to. If you
make science content, what topic is
going to appeal to a larger TAM?
Drilling to the center of the earth or
organic chemistry? If you make law
content, which topic is going to have a
larger tam? You talking about Kim
Kardashian getting her law degree or
section 257 of the bar? Obviously,
drilling to the center of the earth and
Kim K are way more broadly applicable to
more people than the others. You want
simpler concepts, broader concepts, and
ideas that more people can relate to.
And again, this is because a large
possible number of viewers equals more
user minutes, which means the algorithm
will push you more and give you more
opportunities to be shared. These are
the four horsemen things that you need
to do to every single piece of content
to drive maximum views so that you can
win as an entertainment creator. If you
do this, those four elements we just
talked about, the algorithm will be
satisfied, the passive viewer will be
satisfied, other entertainment creators
will be satisfied, and of course, the
brands will be satisfied. So the only
question left is where do we find all
these winning ideas that satisfy those
four criteria factors because that's
really the question. That's really the
thing holding people back. It's not the
execution. It's the ideas that meet that
criteria. We're talking about ideas that
are so shareworthy that even your
competitors in your space have to tip
the cap because they're so unique and
valuable. Now, to find those ideas, what
you want to look for is proven winners
or outliers that came from people that
either knew what they were doing in your
space or accidentally stumbled upon a
brilliant insight. These are proven
outlier ideas that you can remix. This
is why the idea process in content is so
underrated. It's everything to driving
how you win. You want to study what
worked in your category, reverse
engineer, and then remix it. Now, if you
want an easier way to do this process,
to figure out what creators to look at,
which videos won, how to remix them. If
you want an easier way, we're about to
launch our second version of
Sandcastles.ai, which will a,000x this
process for people in terms of how fast
they can do it. It will allow you to
study and track any creators, find
outliers, figure out why they want, and
then remix for yourself in minutes. So,
if this is a process that you want to
learn how to do on speed mode, go to
sandcastle.ai. There's going to be a
video on the landing page where I'll
walk you through the whole thing. Okay,
so to summarize the full playbook as an
entertainment creator to win the
awareness game, all you need to do is
make content that drives these four
things. Shareworthiness,
curiosityinducing hooks, emotional
payoffs, and a large TAM. And if you can
do that consistently, it is just a
volume game from there. Volume against
those four things wins every time. All
right, now let's shift to the conversion
game. I told you this was going to be a
banger. I already gave you the full
playbook and how to win the awareness
game. Let's go conversion. And the good
news is with conversion you can make a
lot more money and you don't experience
those volatile swings of the views up
and down. Now in this game you are not
an entertainment creator, you are an
education creator and you win by driving
as much conversion from social media and
YouTube offplatform to your owned
products and offers. Again, it's been a
while in this video. Let's remind
ourselves of who the players are in the
conversion game that actually matter. In
a conversion game, the only players you
care about, the algorithm, active
viewers, and then both other
entertainment and other education
creators in your niche. Okay, now the
incentives. Let's set the table. Remind
everyone what the incentives are for
those groups. First, the algorithm wants
more user minutes. The way to get more
user minutes for the algorithm is to
make content that has high shares and
high average viewer duration, average
watch time. Second, the active viewers,
the potential buyers, they want tactical
solutions to their pain points.
Specifically, they want immediately
actionable, non-obvious solutions that
actually work. Third, the other
entertainment creators in your space,
they want max views. We just talked
about that in the last awareness game
breakdown. And fourth, the other
education creators, just like us, they
want high conversion from social to
their offers and products as well. Okay,
so similar to the awareness game, the
algorithm works in the exact same way.
It will give us more views if we make
content that drives more shares and more
AVD. But this time to satisfy everyone
else that we care about and our main
mission which is conversion. We don't
want just any views. We want ontarget
views from the right audience. We don't
want just any shares. We want ontarget
shares. And that means we want our
active viewers, the people in our slice
with painoints ideally to only share
with other active viewers in our
category. It turns out that the more
ontarget shares you drive, the more AVD
goes up because the denser an audience
gets around educational content that
actually helps them, the more their
peers also find value. And this makes
sense, right? If you're an accountant
making content for small business
owners, your dream is that certain small
business owners, potential buyers that
find your content valuable, share with
other small business owners that would
find it valuable. Then if they do that,
all of those people that watch the
content are going to watch the whole
thing because it's tactically
implementable. non-obvious solutions.
So, this is the important part to take
away from all that. An active viewer
will watch, re-watch, comment, share,
and beg you to take their money if you
give them tactically implementable
solutions that solve their problems. And
they'll share because they'll get the
professional credit, the hat tip from
their peers for helping them solve their
problems. And again, this same
phenomenon with other education creators
around super shares also applies here.
You ideally want to get other education
creators to share your videos because
they're so valuable and you'll get super
shares which are worth a thousand to
one. Because if a fellow education
creator in your space sees something
from you that is non-obvious and
tactical, they're going to share it with
their audience and that will count as a
super share. So that means for you as an
education creator, all you have to do to
win the conversion game is make content
that does these four things. A is
ontarget shareworthy. B appeals to as
large as possible of an ontarget TAM
total addressable market. C frames the
problem and solution clearly enough so
that the active viewer can actually
understand what you're saying. And then
D offers a tactical useful solve that is
nonobvious and can be implemented
immediately. It turns out this is the
formula for winning the conversion game.
So there's some similarities, but
there's also some really key differences
between the conversion and the awareness
game. Now let's click into these four
things and quickly understand how to do
them. Deep tactics. Okay, again the
first point is ontarget shareworthiness.
You want to make your videos that drive
as many ontarget shares as possible. And
again, this is because the algorithm
loves shares. So the more it gets
shares, the more the algorithm will push
you to people in your slice, which will
help you drive conversion, which is what
you want. And with education content,
especially if it's niche, you know, the
algorithm is only going to push you to
interested parties because niche
specific content really doesn't appeal
to the masses. It will figure that out
and only push you to people that want to
see it. Okay. Now, again, what we said
in the awareness game, what drives
shares? People share things because they
believe they're going to get credit from
their friends or colleagues.
Specifically with education content,
that credit is a super valuable
colleague professional hat tip for
sharing something that's tactically
implementable and solves a problem. And
again, this credit can only be
transferred if the tip, the solve,
actually works and is non-obvious or
unknown to the viewer before. For
example, if you see a super helpful tip
or a motivational story that helps you,
you're going to share it because you
want the recipient to also unlock the
benefit in the same way you did and
attribute the credit back to you
subconsciously. But if they've already
seen that thing five times, the credit's
not getting transferred and you're not
going to share it. So for you as an
education creator, if you want to create
something that has ontarget
shareworthiness, it needs to be valuable
obviously, but you also have to be first
andor different to the topic you're
sharing. Okay. The second variable that
matters in your content to winning the
conversion game is having a large
ontarget TAM. Again, TAM is total
addressable market. The total population
of viewers that would find this topic or
video valuable. And this point is very
similar to the TAM explanation I made in
the awareness game with one key
difference. Specifically, we want only
viewers that are in our slice that have
the pain points that could potentially
be active buyers. And what this really
means is being disciplined enough to
only pick content topics that would
actually be tactically valuable for the
people that would buy our products. This
precision of topic selection is really
important in the conversion education
game because it helps build the habit in
the viewer's brain that you are someone
that solves their problems in this
category. If we expand the aperture too
wide with the topics we pick and we try
to broaden the TAM too much, we may miss
the mark on tactically providing value
and then those viewers will start to
train their brain that we don't always
hit the mark for them. Okay. The third
aspect to winning content in the
conversion game is problem solution
clarity. In your videos, you want to
frame the problem and solution so
clearly that it will be impossible for a
viewer to misunderstand what you're
talking about. Because a critical piece
in delivering something of value is that
the viewer actually understands what
you're saying so they can gauge if the
information works. And this is all about
delivering your concepts in simple
frames with simple words with high
comprehension. Now, I talk about
comprehension and clarity a ton in my
other videos. All the ones on hooks and
script writing cover that. So, if you
need more help tactically there, watch
those. I'll say this, the laser precise
clarity down to the single word is a
little bit less important in the
awareness game because the topics you're
talking about are inherently very well
understood. They're mimetic and they
share on their own. With education
content that's precise and deep, clarity
is everything. Okay. Now, the last
component in how to make winning content
to win the conversion game is this. You
must offer a tactical, useful solve that
is nonobvious and immediately
implementable. Okay. What does that
mean? Ask yourself this question. Is
there walkway value in what you shared?
Could the viewer walk away from the
video and make a change that improves
their situation in their life or
business? And that's the key difference
between entertainment and education. In
education, the viewer can walk away,
make a change, and see an improvement.
Entertainment, they can walk away and
know that they were entertained. So,
does your content do this effectively or
not? This is very binary test. If it
does, you satisfied this condition, and
you will win. If it doesn't, then your
content is really not educational. It's
actually entertainment in disguise.
Okay, those are the four horsemen things
that you need to do to drive maximum
conversion in your category. If you do
this, the algorithm will respond
favorably and push you more and the
active viewer will respond favorably as
well because you're helping them
tactically. Now, in the conversion game,
the absolute number of views you're
getting will not be as high, but the
conversion and the monetization will be
much higher. Now, one last question. Why
in the conversion game do we want to pay
attention to both other entertainment
creators and educational creators? When
it comes to the awareness game,
entertainment creators don't really need
to pay attention to educational because
all they care about is views and the
educational content is getting less
views. So, it's not as helpful for
inspiration. However, when it's the
reverse, educational creators can
actually learn a lot from the other
entertainment creators in their space.
It's often the case that an
entertainment creator will stumble on a
very useful premise, but not get the
viral reach that they're looking for
because it was poor execution. The
education creator can see that premise,
extract it, and remix it in a tactically
valuable way. That's a great place to
look for ideas. Obviously, the best
place to look for ideas as an education
creator is other education creators in
your space, but the entertainment ones
can also provide sneaky good
inspiration. Again, the way to come up
with these ideas, whether you're talking
about education or entertainment, is to
study what worked already, analyze the
reasons, and then remix. And if you want
an easy way to do this, Sandcastles.ai,
our new product, is insane for this.
Okay, so to summarize, all you need to
do to win the conversion game is make
content that drives to these four
attributes. A onarget shareworthiness, B
a large ontarget TAM, C unmistakable
clarity in the framing of the problem
and solution. And D valuable insights
that are tactically implementable and
non-obvious. And if you can do this
consistently in every piece of content,
then it's just a volume game from there.
The most volume wins. So this is how I
think about the psychology of the
players in the social media games. Now,
of course, some of this will seem kind
of obvious in retrospect once I've
explained it. You still have to make
good videos. You still have to do it at
a high volume consistently. And you
still have to have clarity in your
messaging. But what's nonobvious are the
core components that you need to use as
a checklist to make sure you're giving
the other players in the ecosystem what
they want and the differences between
the awareness and the conversion game.
As someone who's played both games, you
will get way more dopamine and fun
playing the entertainment game, but will
make way more money and have way more
conversion and stability playing the
conversion game. Either way, no matter
which game you're playing, the key is
the idea. And to get the best ideas, you
want to leverage what the other creators
in your space have done, analyze why
they won, and remix. There's no better
way to do that than sand castles.ai.
That's what I've been building for the
last 6 months so that it makes it easier
for you. If you want to learn this whole
idea process, I walk through the whole
thing. Go to sandcastle.ai. There's a

All right, guys. That is all I've got
for this video. As a recap, we covered
the full game theory approach to social
media. First, we broke down what game
theory actually is. Second, we dove into
all the players in the social media
ecosystem. Then, we studied third, the
incentives of those players. Fourth, we
broke down social media into two games,
the awareness game and the conversion
game. And then, finally, fifth, we
dissected the winning strategies for
each game based on the incentives and
behaviors of those players. If you like
