## Transcript

social media is one giant video game and
chances are if you're watching this
you're not winning as much as you could
be because the truth is there are cheat
codes and strategies that the top 1% of
creators are using to stay ahead that's
why they keep winning they're playing a
smarter game than you now I've spent the
last 2 years obsessing over the social
media game because I was like you I
didn't understand how these people were
having so much success well now I have a
million followers I've done billions of
views I made
$120,000 last month in Profit just from
posting content on social media I've
learned the cheat codes and I'm just
going to give them to you because I want
to see more people win so in this video
I'm going to break down exactly how to
win the social media game the strategy
the tactics the adjustments and the
mindset if you're an entrepreneur this
is the blueprint for how to turn
attention into Dollars now it turns out
social media is the best video game ever
invented billions of players spending
hours per day fighting tooth and nail
for likes and followers everyone is
trying to get a leg up people are
fighting for clout it's pretty crazy
when you really think about it but the
truth is if you actually know what
you're doing social media is way better
than a video game because on social
media the points are dollars and if you
master this one game you're going to be
set forever here's how to play If you're
trying to build businesses using content
you only have one job to become the best
time allocator in the world this is the
game within the game when you have no
skills no audience no traction and no
Team all you have is time and energy so
think of your time in 1 hour blocks you
have 40 time blocks per week to place on
the social media board and each week you
get 40 more now the board is made up of
platforms formats audiences and messages
platforms are places like Instagram
YouTube or X these are the places you
can post the where formats are things
like short form videos email newsletters
or video podcasts these are the types of
content you can make the how audiences
are things like entrepreneurs
grandmothers or students these are the
people you can reach The Who and
messages are things like expertise
Frameworks or playbooks these are the
things you can say the what now every
time you make a piece of content you're
saying some message to some audience on
some platform in some format and each of
those combinations has a different cost
in time blocks to make a video podcast
for dentists on YouTube posted one time
per week might cost 10 time units to
make a short post to students sharing
learning tips on X might only take one/
tenth of a Time block to make now your
ultimate goal to win the social media
game is that every time you burn a Time
block of energy dollars eventually come
back and to do this you need your
message to reach the Right audience
through the right format on the right
platform to get them to take an action
that gives you dollars in return this
could be them buying your product
signing up for your email list or the
platform giving you a share of the
advertising revenue from them watching
no matter if you're a day one Creator or
you run a billion dollar brand the
approach for winning the social media
game is the exact same how do you
allocate time time blocks in the most
optimal way to get the most dollars back
for the least time spent that's the
entire game and when I started thinking
about it using that framework my mindset
and approach completely changed now in
this video I'm going to share my
thoughts on what I think are the
Tactical strategies for winning the game
what is the best way to spend those time
blocks to hack the dollars coming back
and let me be clear life is not all
about money I know this there is so much
Beauty in Creative expression and
artistic exploration if you love making
content for the art of it and you're not
really concerned with monetization
you've already won this video is
probably not for you just keep doing
what you're doing you're crushing but
for me and for most of you that are
entrepreneurs I want to use content to
build businesses to earn money to unlock
time freedom in my life so the social
media metric that I'm most interested in
figuring out isn't likes isn't comments
isn't followers it's dollars I want to
put my time in and get dollars out
that's what entrepreneurs really want at
the end of the day so for the rest of
the video I'm going to walk through
three things the first is why are you
losing the social media game today what
are you doing wrong and why is the time
you're spending not bringing dollars
back the second what are the top
creators doing that lets them win so
much what are they doing right how are
they making millions per month and then
third and most important how should you
shift your strategy to go from losing to
winning how do you build this content
engine that turns attention into Dollars
by the end of this if you watch this
entire video I guarantee you will be
nable to reset the strategy for how you
think about winning the game okay so
first why are you losing today well when
it comes comes to social media what
really is losing losing is spending a
lot of time and not getting dollars back
you're working and working and working
and you're seeing no reward now there's
two reasons why this is happening one is
good and one is bad the good one is when
you're in the investment stage when you
burn time blocks without getting dollars
directly back in return this is
considered an investment an energy
investment and this means you're
building momentum building some skills
taking those early reps to improve and
really learn the game at first all of
your time blocks will be spent as
Investments as you to kind of get that
machine going and this is not only
encouraged this is required this is a
necessary step for everyone so if you're
on the right path and you're in the
investment stage you're just early so
you're all good but the bad scenario
which you absolutely must avoid is when
you're strategically misaligned this is
when you're on the wrong path when
you're spending time but you're playing
based on a bad strategy that's a huge
problem that would be like investing to
build a castle on this map but all the
gold is over here on this map it's just
wasted effort the other way this happens
which is super common is that you're not
really sure why you're doing what you're
doing you're just doing something to be
doing something again this is also
probably not good what I found after
helping hundreds of entrepreneurs try to
crack the social media game for their
business is that most of the time their
effort was being placed in the wrong
area it's not bad effort it's just
misdirected so they were losing this is
a strategy issue and the reason this is
the biggest problem is because no amount
of rowing can make a boat go forward if
it's pointed backwards you can row
faster you can buy state-of-the-art ORS
you can even hire the strongest fastest
rowers in the world but if your boat is
pointed the wrong way you are not going
to row forward my biggest mistake with
content for the first 5 years when I was
failing over and over and over is that I
didn't have a smart strategy because I
didn't know how to think about social
media strategy I didn't understand the
game you must have a sound strategy you
have to point the boat in the right
direction or else all that rowing is
going to be wasted effort now I used to
be a strategy consultant this is what I
do this is what I spend all my time
doing so again we will solve the
strategy issue for how to win the social
media game by the end of this video okay
so the second thing I said I'd cover and
I'll do it quickly are the main reasons
why the top 1% creators keep winning
this social media game these are the
people making millions of dollars a
month no joke it's insane real money
they are crushing how are they doing
this what are they doing differently
than you and you're going to hate this
but the answer is actually super simple
the first thing is they have a super
sound strategy which again we're going
to cover in a second they are rowing in
the right direction second once they
confirm that was the right strategy they
put all their focus and intensity on
this pure Focus around one thing with
zero wasted effort the third thing is
any dollar they made they rolled it back
into that strategy to apply leverage
this means if they made 3K in Revenue
they will pay 3K to hire an editor and
buy 40 more editor blocks to spin the
wheel faster and then fourth they didn't
get distracted they didn't get bored
they kept staying focused for 5 to 10
years now obviously this sounds super
high level and not tactical it is
because the truth is once you have the
right strategy all you have to do to to
win the social media game is the basics
a bunch consistently without losing
focus it's just pick a strategy validate
the straty do it for a decade and you're
guaranteed to be rich and it really is
that simple because social media gives
you unlimited distribution for free
there is nothing better in the world so
this will work every single time okay so
let's get into the strategy that's what
you're here for right I didn't mean to
bury it at the end I just think it's
super helpful to think about how the
players are playing and understand why
social media is a game before we get
into it so now let's get into the main
thing the big question is how do you
pick the right strategy to win the
social media game and what this really
means is how do you pick the optimal set
of format platform audience and message
to earn you the most dollars with the
least amount of time spent first you
need to start at the end with the offer
what are you selling if you're an
entrepreneur you either have a product
or you are the product if you have a
product or service that already has
Revenue you have a pretty clear idea for
who that buyer is if you don't have a
product or service you are the product
this just means you're a media company
so Brands will pay you to rent your
audience for a post but whether or not
you have a product or not you need to
understand your ideal viewer avatar for
business owners this is your buyer for
media companies this is your viewer
they're the same thing your ideal viewer
Avatar in other words who do we want
viewing the content so they buy what
we're selling or who do we want viewing
the content so that Brands will pay us
so that they can buy what they're
selling the first thing you need to do
is figure out who this person is nothing
else Else Matters until you do this now
to figure it out I like to run the chair
test if you could generate your ideal
viewer Avatar in a lab and sit them in a
chair in front of you what would they
say what would they be like what
messages would resonate with them what
are their pain points how do they like
being talked to what are their needs you
need to learn who this person is so you
can understand how to make the right
content in the right format on the right
platform with the right message the
biggest mistake I see entrepreneurs make
is they start with the platform or the
format first so they say things like we
need to do YouTube or we need to make
videos in this style this is the wrong
approach and a massive trap don't start
with the format or the platform or even
the message start with the audience who
do I need a crowd of to buy the thing
that I sell and if you're a media
company who do I need a crowd of so that
Brands pay me to buy the things that
they sell if you want to make money from
content this is the most important place
to start this is critical this is the
whole game all of the winners on social\nmedia that you look up to that make tons
of money have engineered their entire
content system to Target one specific
ideal viewer Avatar Persona you need to
do this first now if you have a product
you're already selling and you know the
buyer because it's working then you
already have who your audience profile
should be it's the buyer so the who the
audience is already solved for you so
next you need to figure out the platform
where do these people hang out where do
they spend the most Time online you need
to start with one single hero Platform
One platform go all in crush it and then
move on now there are hundreds of
thousands of entrepreneurs that are
going to watch this video across
thousands of different different
businesses and business models so I
can't give the exact answer for exactly
which platform combination you for your
business should focus on it's just
impossible everyone has a different
answer this is why I work with
entrepreneurs one-on-one and in my
Academy so I can't answer that exact
answer for you today in this video but
what I want to do is go through the
structure for how you would think about
figuring this out for yourself so you
need to think where does my ideal viewer
Avatar spend time if it's a B2B audience
it's probably going to be on LinkedIn or
YouTube if it's a consumer product it's
probably going to be on Instagram or Tik
Tok or maybe YouTube if it's an agency
service it could be anywhere kind of
depends on the agency and the audience
buyer profile you just need to figure
out the dominant place that these people
spend time most audiences live on
multiple platforms I'll talk about that
in a second but you just need to start
with one what is the number one place
that they spend time and a hack for this
is just to ask your customers where they
are or watch how their comments or
engagement come in what platform do they
come from now once you have the platform
where they spend the most time next you
need to figure out the format so you
have The Who and you have the wear but
what format should we make to reach them
on that platform and I'll save you the
trouble this is the answer video is best
video is King video allows you to build
the most trust with the fewest amount of
reps make video video is the answer a
picture is worth a th000 words a video
is worth a th000 pictures it's video
stop there so then you really have three
options for video formats you have short
form video like Instagram reals or Tik
Tok you have medium form video like this
video on YouTube and then you have a
long form video podcast one of those
three is going to work on every every
single platform and there's a reason why
they all Incorporated video cuz everyone
loves it so the secret is that you need
to pick whichever of those three video
formats is most native to the dominant
platform because native will unlock the
most algorithm push let me explain what
that means when you make a piece of
content you get a manual push which is
your followers sharing with others and
then you get an algorithmic push which
is the algorithm pushing your stuff to
non-followers the algorithm push is like
the house giving you free attention
coupons so you want to make whatever
content format on that platform will
unlock the biggest algorithm push
possible and this is probably going to
be the one that is native to that
platform and by native I just mean the
one that is most dominantly used by
users on that platform so for Twitter
native is text for LinkedIn native is
now text or video for YouTube Native is
video so for example if your ideal
viewer Avatar is most prevalent on
LinkedIn that's where they spend the
most time LinkedIn has text posts but
they now have short form video post
looped in in the feed as well they even
have a tab in their app dedicated to
video and that short form now medium
form video like this and long form video
like podcast those are not native to
LinkedIn you could post them on LinkedIn
post them on YouTube and post them as a
text post but they're not native and
those aren't going to do as well as
native short form or text post why is
that it's because anyone that clicks on
the medium form YouTube link will go to
YouTube and they will leave LinkedIn and
when they leave LinkedIn their user
session ends and Linkedin stops getting
ad dollars it's very simple LinkedIn
wants the native engagement format to be
the thing that people love the most so
that's what they push so in this case if
you're looking at LinkedIn you have text
post or short form video video is better
so you make short form video so now we
have the who the where and the how the
last thing we need is the what which is
the message what message should you say
through short form video on LinkedIn to
the buyer in this example and that
message or set of messages is just going
to Target the deepest and most acute
pain points that that viewer has because
the deeper the pain the more trust they
will associate if you solve it the more
money they will spend to solve it you
want deep pain now this Matrix the
audience the platform the format the
message this is the strategy construct
for how you win the social media game if
you can figure out how to allocate your
time units the best way possible across
that Matrix you win and the strategy is
that you pick one combination of this
the absolute strongest one that can
reach your target ideal viewer Avatar go
all in for 6 months on just solving one
format one platform one set of messages
for that Avatar all in 6 months then
when this is working for you you have
two choices the first is you could take
the Revenue hire yourself out of that
platform and just let it cook or second
you could take the revenue and fund a
team for the second platform now you
have two platforms LinkedIn and YouTube
and you keep going until you've built
all of the different content formats up
feeding each other that's how you win
the social media game so if you're
selling a B2B product and your ideal
viewer Avatar is dominant on LinkedIn
but they're also a little bit on YouTube
you might decide to First crack LinkedIn
you laser focus here first you make
short form video on LinkedIn you print
Revenue because the viewers are engaging
with with the video and going down your
funnel and buying your product you take
that Revenue you hire a YouTube team and
then you add YouTube now you have
LinkedIn and YouTube but a common
question is this what if our ideal
viewer Avatar lives on multiple
platforms with the same density let's
say it's LinkedIn and YouTube equally
then how do we decide which one we start
with first now there's three factors
that matter when your ideal viewer
Avatar lives on multiple places with the
same density the first consideration is
which platform builds deeper audience
trust the fastest and this gets to my
framework on content minutes which I've
talked about before you need to
accumulate a certain number of viewer
minutes in order to build trust with
that individual the longer the video the
more content minutes per rep that you're
nable to unlock the trade-off is that
longer form videos don't get that many
users watching them so the number of
minutes per person is high but the
actual number of people that were
exposed to it is low now if your product
is high ticket you actually don't need
that many people watching it a few
hundred honestly converting could make
your business and so if your product is
high ticket you may want to start with a
little bit of a longer video format that
will help build trust faster and get
deeper with audiences past that content
minute line sooner but if your product
is lower ticket you need a lot of people
to end up buying it for it to move the
needle for your business and if that's
true you may not want to wait as long as
it takes to get longer formats to grow
so the first thing is Speed Of Trust the
second thing is which platform or format
would cause you to quit sooner the truth
is the only way you lose this content
game is by quitting if you pick a longer
format that grows slower and takes way
more effort per rep like a podcast for
example you have a higher likelihood of
quitting if you're dependent on seeing
those results in a certain period of
time so if spending 5 years growing a
podcast without traction is going to
cause you to quit don't pick a podcast
cuz if you quit you lose roughly
speaking short form video will take
about 2 to 6 months to start seeing
results YouTube 6 to 12 months and a
long form podcast could take 2 to 3
years or more to start seeing results so
if you can't wait 12 months before you
start seeing results don't pick
something that will take longer than 12
months to start seeing them or else
you're going to quit now the third
Factor when you're trying to break the
tie is which platform do you have unique
ability in solving are you an amazing
editor are you amazing at long form
conversation are you uniquely good at
teaching if you have some unique
advantage that's slanting you towards
being better at a certain format and
you're okay with the negative trade-offs
that come from those points I just
mentioned you should probably go with
that one so again I work with
entrepreneurs trying to figure this out
one-on-one and in my Academy because
there's so much nuance and important in
picking where you play but the answer is
simple one of the video formats on one
platform targeted at one user Avatar
with a few different mess is mixed in
that's the answer again if you're clear
on this strategy and how it applies to
you and where to play and now you just
need help on the how like how do I go
faster I've got a bunch of free stuff
Below in the description about systems
and tools ways to get faster if you're
on the right track but just out of time
wavy world is a free community with like
10,000 other creators I'm even about to
launch an amazing software sandcastles a
that will actually write the scripts for
your videos for you it'll go research
the video and write the full script in
like 60 seconds that's the kind of tool
you need to improve the time that it
takes to do something okay now the last
thing I want to cover really quick is
what happens if you don't have a product
yet and you're just trying to pick what
the product is or trying to pick what
that audience might be well you're in
luck cuz I'm going to save you a lot of
Heartache if you catch this before you
started too far because if you have a
product already and you have a buyer
your ideal viewer Avatar is the buyer so
you don't really have a choice you got
to figure out where they are but if you
don't have a product yet and the world
is your oyster oh it's so fun to try to
pick what that ideal viewer Avatar could
be so let me walk you through my
framework for you and this is a big area
where people get tripped up do not pick
an audience that brands do not want to
spend money to acquire this is a massive
trap if you do this you will struggle to
monetize from your channel This Is Where
The Starving Artists come from and I
hate saying it but it's the truth and
I'd want this warning if I were starting
out if you're targeting a buyer group
that does not have money and you Cann
sell things to them then you are
essentially just free TV for them
competing with Mr Beast and the only way
you're going to monetize is for your
split of the advertising Revenue which
you don't want to rely on the max this
is going to be is 10 to 20K on YouTube
that's the most and it's going to take
you 5 years to get there don't pick a
buyer group that doesn't have money cuz
the thing is it doesn't have to be this
way you don't have to be limited to
AdSense on YouTube your goal is to pick
an audience that has a lot of money or
more importantly is willing to spend a
lot of money to get a certain problem
solved and the reason they'd spend a lot
of money is because their return on
investment for solving that problem is
much higher so they can spend a lot so
let me just tell you how I think about
this from a strategy perspective your
ideal view Avatar if you could pick
anything should come come from a combo
of these three factors the first is do
you have any existing expertise or
skills because if you already have
locked knowledge that's in your head
that's a skill set that just needs to be
extracted well then you should start
here that's your offer that's how you
craft your offer and you work backwards
for who the ideal viewer Avatar that
would want that skill set is gaining the
actually valuable knowledge that's the
whole game here so if you already have
the knowledge or you have a unique skill
set that is valuable start there you're
good now if you don't have any knowledge
or skills or the skills you have you
feel like aren't super valuable you then
have to think about one of these two
factors and this is okay everybody
starts here but this is what you think
about one is Market opportunities and
two is the buyer Revenue potential so
Market opportunities are just skills or
knowledge that is in demand or going to
be increasingly in demand as time moves
on so in this current ERA it could be
anything AI related how to use AI tools
AI consultancy helping people build AI
workflows it could be marketing it could
be growth it could be blue colar work
you go down the list of in demand skill
sets and you pick one and that's what
you build the other approach is buyer
Revenue potential you pick the most
lucrative potential buyer figure out
what they would pay the most to have
solved and then learn that skill set
again right now this is anything AI
related workflow related marketing
there's so many things that you could
pick from if you guys want another video
where I break down kind of what I see
the trending in demand skill sets to
learn I can do that as well but
essentially if you don't have a product
or offer you need to build a skill set
or knowledge that is interesting and
compelling for someone to buy so that
you can make an offer to figure out who
would buy the offer that's really what
this game boils down to do you have
expertise or knowledge that people will
pay for and then using social media to
help get them to know where to go to pay
for it that's basically what this game
is and again there's plenty of
entertainment focused channels that you
guys follow they're playing a different
game they are essentially just TV
playing the ad dollars game that's a
really hard game to win and it doesn't
have to be like that if you follow what
I just said you can monetize way easier
with way less stress so to summarize
this is the strategy for winning the
social media game I'm going to give it
to you right here first Define your
offer or if you're the brand you're the
product then your audience if you're
media second get super clear on who that
ideal viewer Avatar is based on that
offer who are they where do they spend
time where do they live three is to pick
the number one combination of platform
format and message to reach your ideal
audience where is the highest density
that they spend time Focus exclusively
there four is to pick one of the video
content formats ideally the native one
to that platform so for Instagram it's
short form reals for YouTube it's this
medium form YouTube video five is to
focus extremely intensely on cracking
that one format on that one platform
with a small set of messages for that
one audience Focus exclusively on
cracking just that six that will build
max trust the fastest leading to revenue
which you can then extract out and build
on a second combination of platforms
formats and messages seven roll that
Revenue into either hiring a team to
leave behind on Platform One while while
you go build platform two or hire the
team and place them on platform two so
that you keep going on one and they
build two either way that is how you
build the content Empire now this is the
winning strategy it works every time for
every business you just have to figure
nout which combination makes sense for
your business your offer and your ideal
viewer Avatar and I know this sounds
high level but just the thinking of
starting with the Avatar and going
backwards just that is different from
what everybody that I hear on social
media talking about these genius
Frameworks start with the Avatar and
work backwards that is all you have to
do now the how of how you actually
execute this across your combination
that's what takes a ton of reps a ton of
time better workflows that's what I work
with entrepreneurs on is figuring out
once you have the strategy how to
compress the time to deliver the how
I've spent all of my time last year
building these systems that allow that
compression so if you're clear on the
strategy and you need help with the how
I'm telling you in the description Wavey
World content Department sand castles
these are things designed specifically
to make it easier to execute against
these strategies now I have some
exciting announcements coming up soon
about the house so stay tuned about that
but that's all I've got for this video
if you liked it make sure to leave a
comment let me know what I should make
in the next video and until then we'll
see you guys on the next one peace
