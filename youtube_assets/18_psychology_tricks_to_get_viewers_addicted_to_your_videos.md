## Transcript

today we're talking about psychology
this is the biggest secret weapon used
by all of your favorite creators they
are masters of this if you want your
videos to perform better all you have to
study is human psychology but it's not
just psychology principles you can't
learn this content stuff in a book
social media psychology is how to
engineer your storytelling to get a
viewer to think and act how you want and
if you can do this on command you win
now I have over a million followers done
a billion views and this one thing has
been the biggest cheat code to my
success it is the foundational building
block that powers everything and I'm
just going to give it to you this is my
full content psychology Playbook 18
different tricks that you can use to get
people addicted to your videos without
them knowing it all right so I boil down
every video into six steps think of
these like Gates or checkpoints and I
need to get the viewer through these six
checkpoints before they bounce or the
video flops now for each one I use a
combination of different psychology
hacks to pull them through and I'm going
to break down each one of those hacks
and how you can use them in your videos
okay so the first major checkpoint in
any video is paino acceptance before you
do anything else you have to get the
viewer to feel whatever pain point it is
you're solving for in the video usually
the core pain stems from not having
enough money time health or access those
are the four horsemen of pain and
there's many ways to frame a pain but at
a base level before you do anything else
in the video the viewer has to feel a
pain point now I can already hear the
skep iics in the nose beds what about
entertainment style content like Mr
Beast or Minecraft videos there's no
pain point in those and you're 100%
right those are pure entertainment plays
and those can work but my take is that
if you're playing for pure entertainment
the competition is much much steeper
because you're competing against family
time Hollywood grade movies Mr Beast
himself the Instagram feed reading in
bed if you're not an absolute Pro you're
going to lose the entertainment game but
if you're solving a specific paino all
of a sudden you fit into a different
category in the viewer's brain and if
your goal is to make money online Value
First paino driven content is the best
way to do it okay so checkpoint one is
making them accept the pain now what are
the exact psychological hacks to get
them to do this I have four methods the
first one is by going one standard
deviation away from the pain to trick
them into accepting it so let me explain
what that means the key with content is
getting a viewer to opt into accepting
they have a paino without triggering
their be s detector it's like robbing a
bank if you trip the red wire the alarms
will go off and they're going to call
the police you remember when I said all
core pain stem from not having time
money health or access well the problem
is if you come out directly and say
something like if you want to make more
money do this it often triggers their BS
detector and they'll dismiss you and
this happens because most viewers are
smart and they think to themselves Well
it can't be that easy right this must be
nonsense and so then they start second
guessing what you're saying and this is
all happening subconsciously because of
their psychology once the BS detector is
tripped in their mind you've lost them
because now they don't trust you so this
is where the one standard deviation away
hack comes in sometimes it could be
easier to get someone to opt into a pain
by going one standard deviation away
from what they actually want and having
them make the leap themselves for
example let's take the pain of trying to
grow on social media that's what I talk
about most people want to grow on social
media because they think it'll help them
make more money they don't actually want
to spend 40 hours a week making videos
they want the money but the beauty is
that most people assume that if they
grow on social media they will make
money they treat them as the same so
targeting the pain that they aren't
growing their social channels fast
enough is a way to disarm them on the
money pain without triggering their BS
detector they will make the leap that
you helping them with social media will
help them make more money which is what
they really want and to prove this is
the case if you look at all of my videos
on my YouTube channel anytime I talk
specifically about making more money
those videos don't perform very well but
anytime I talk about specifics of making
better videos or new social trends for
growing faster people associate that
with making more money and those videos
crush and this isn't an accident this is
psychology at work so the specific
tactic here is understanding which of
the four horsemen base pains you're
targeting and then figuring out how to
go one standard deviation away to solve
a tactical problem all right the second
hack for trying to get a viewer to
accept the paino is what I call twisting
the knife here your goal is to remind
the viewer of their paino and the
frustration that they've been
experiencing because they haven't solved
it twist the knife the best way to do
this tactically no surprise is to talk
about the pain point and that
frustration as bluntly and directly as
possible so for example I might say
something like if you've been struggling
with storytelling I've been there I know
how hard it is this reminds them of the
struggle and deepens the Gap it seems
obvious but this is adding Tinder to the
burning fire of them wanting to solve
the problem also fomo and jealousy are
other great ways to remind them of this
frustration and deepen the pain all
right the third psychology hack for
getting a viewer to accept the pain
point is what I call an audience of one
and this is very simple speak to them
directly don't use the word I use the
word you make it about them make them
the main character make them think about
themselves and their unique situation I
use the word you more than any other
word in my videos it's like a teacher
yelling hey you to a group of
kindergarteners right it stuns them
immediately and makes them lock back in
I also try in my delivery to make it
seem like I'm talking directly to you
and no one else and this comes mostly
from tone and Rhythm which you have to
just adjust over time the best way to do
this is observe two people having a
conversation and then try to mimic that
tone and Rhythm nobody wants a preacher
they want a friend again these things
seem obvious and I'm going to show you
an example in a second about why they're
so powerful but I'm telling you stacking
these on top of each other creates this
deep pain Point all right the fourth and
last hack for getting a user to accept
the paino is to create the paino
solution Gap you need them to realize
that there is both a paino to be solved
and a gap between between where they are
today and where they want to be you can
do this tactically by literally moving
your hands from one side to the other or
you could use Graphics or you could
continue to Pepper examples showing the
distance between where they are and
where they want to be as you can tell
and I've heard this in the comments I
find the hands thing to be super helpful
with this now you don't have to do all
four of those hacks all together every
single video but by doing these four
things you make them aware of the right
pain frame it so it applies to them
specifically and build an urgency for
them to figure out how to close the gap
if you do this you have them Hook Line
and Sinker through that first checkpoint
and they are super eager to find out
what comes next now I'm going to show
you an example the first three
checkpoints all happen in the hook of
the video in the first 10 to 30 seconds
so I'm really breaking it down but this
happens super super quickly getting them
through those first three checkpoints
let's review the hook that I used in
this video just a couple minutes ago and
I'm going to show you exactly how I do
this in practice by the way the reason
you're still watching is because I use
this exact psychology hack to hook you
so if you're wondering if it works it
works today we're talking about about
psychology this is the biggest secret
weapon used by all of your favorite
creators they are masters of this if you
want your videos to perform better all
you have to study is human psychology
but it's not just psychology principles
you can't learn this content stuff in a
book social media psychology is how to
engineer your storytelling to get a
viewer to think and act how you want and
if you can do this on command you win
all right so here's the transcript of
the first half of the hook for this
video and I'm going to color code each
of the four psychology hacks that deal
with this first paino checkpoint now the
first line is just me setting context
that it's about psychology I kind of had
to do that then immediately I start
twisting the knife using jealousy I say
this is the biggest secret weapon used
by all your favorite creators now I
could have started by explicitly stating
the pain itself like you're trying to
grow on social media through video but
that is implied by me using Creator so
at this point subconsciously you feel
this frustration cuz you want to grow
like your favorite creators but you
haven't figured it out I'm reminding you
of that frustration subconsciously that
deepens the paino Gap if you want your
videos to perform better so I'm saying
it directly right here again I know
every single person watching this wants
to make money that's why they're trying
to grow on social media so this is the
one standard deviation away from the
core Four Horseman pain now that rolls
directly into the paino solution Gap if
you want better videos paino you need to
understand psychology solution and this
is all happening in real time but like 7
seconds in I've already kind of got you
deeply reminded of the pain jealous
about the other creators and interested
in how to solve it happens fast now
because psychology as a concept is kind
of high level and not clear I decided to
use another line to reiterate exactly
what I'm talking about and how you can
apply it to making better videos so I
say psychology is how you engineer
people to do and act how you want and if
you do this you can win again paino
solution Gap if you do this you can win
now the last thing to highlight is how
many times I use the word you in the
first half of this hook nine times and I
use the word I zero this is also
intentional this video video is not
about me it's about you it's about
helping you solve the pain I'm not
talking about me yet now I spent so much
time on checkpoint one in this video so
far because again if you can't get the
viewer to accept that there's a pain
point you lose do not pass go there is
no reason to continue you have to nail
this first now before I go on to the
next checkpoints why does this work so
well it works so well because human
brains are problem-solving machines if
you give a brain a problem it is
designed to figure out how to solve it
by starting with the problem in the
video script we are hacking the viewers
neurochemistry to get them to pay
attention to it and this first step is
critical because it aligns their
subconscious on the problem so that you
can tell them the rest of the story
before watching the video they may not
have been problem aware or if they knew
the problem they weren't consciously
focusing so you need to angle their
attention on the problem and then
continue okay so this is checkpoint one
at this point the viewer is now deeply
problem aware and interested in figuring
out how to solve it all right before I
move on and there is some gold coming up
I just got to say guys nobody talks
about content the way I do I've looked
so far for people to make videos like
this and there just aren't any I take
all of this and I put it for free in the
description in my free community wavy
world my free newsletter content. game I
want you guys to win I think there's so
much opportunity for everyone to win the
way they want so I give it all for free
make sure you check the description if
you like the way I talk about this stuff
all right let's keep going okay so as
soon as the viewer is aware of the paino
The Next Step checkpoint two you need to
immediately Sprint to trust you you need
them to trust you ASAP you essentially
have between 10 and 30 seconds after
they accept that a problem is real to
pass their BS detector for them to trust
that you're the type of person that
could solve it if they sense that you
don't know what you're talking about
that you don't have proof that you've
done this before or that you don't have
the answer they're going to bounce and
you lose them and this checkpoint 2 is
another make or break moment in
Psychology hacking do they trust you so
what are the ways to get them to trust
you this is the list in order from most
effective to least effective the best in
top of the list is proof that you have
solved this problem for someone just
like them this is why On Target case
studies and testimonials are so critical
it's why they're all over sales Pages if
a viewer sees themselves in a success
story that you have they immediately
trust that you can do this for them if
you don't have a testimonial of you
doing this for others the next best case
is proof that you've done it for
yourself this proves that you can do it
but they may not trust you as much as
the testimonial if they don't see
themselves in you the third highest
trust Builder would be massive social
followings on any account ideally the
account you're on or a prei cosign from
someone that they trust social
followings basically prove that you are
trusted and vetted by many at scale this
helps decrease their fear that you don't
know what you're talking about the
fourth is evidence that you have been in
their shoes and you are not in their
shoes anymore this doesn't necessarily
mean that you were the one that
controlled the transformation but it
does mean you have underwent the
transformation so you at least know
where they have been and where they want
to go Fifth and this is second from the
bottom is Common Ground anything you can
do to build common ground between them
and you just to build rapport and then
last but I think still effective is the
overall look and quality of your
presentation of the information the
studio the audio the confidence the
posture the way the whole package is put
together if you come off like you know
what you're doing they will
subconsciously start to trust you a
little bit this alone isn't going to get
you there but it's helpful icing on the
top and this look thing this is why most
sales people wear suits there's a reason
why people do the things they do why
they put testimonials on their sites why
sales people wear suits is because
they're trying to build trust now like I
said you don't need the full one through
six list to be true if you have any one
of the top three you're probably good
that's all you need but if you don't you
may need multiple of the bottom three
the bigger the ask the more trust
required the deeper the pain the less
trust required now I have three super
quick psychological hacks that go one
level deeper for how you actually
facilitate this trust transfer so the
first one around proof this is going to
sound stupidly obvious but use
screenshots of the testimonials bank
statements a B tests before and afters
social followings some visual proof is
usually all you need to justify
credibility that you've done what you
say and it usually just takes one or two
of these flashed rapidly and then the
trust is built now if you have no proof
you need to build common ground or show
that you've been in their shoes before
and even if you try this it may not
stick but you have to try something the
best way to build common ground is to
hack their subconscious Psychology by
saying things like I've been exactly
where you are I've gone through this
same thing I know what it feels like
right saying those things helps build
empathy empathy and Common Ground
between them and you at this point if
you don't have proof they are running
the BS filter scan in their head
absorbing everything trying to vet do I
trust them do I trust them and I'll be
honest the longer they're running that
BS scan the less chance you have so you
really want to establish trust as
quickly as possible now in addition to
building Common Ground an easy way to
hack their trust like I said is having a
professional setup this is a huge way to
increase trust because when you're small
and you have no credibility you have no
proof but people see you have a legit
set up immediately in their mind they're
wondering wait how does this person not
have any proof how does this person not
have any wins he has such a great setup
she has such a great setup they actually
start to root for you in a weird way it
inverts that's why having this
professional look is so critical again
if you have crazy proof you can record
on a lowquality 720p camera in your
underwear but if you don't have any
proof this is a way to kind of elevate
yourself without having done anything
else again this trust checkpoint is
critical if the viewer does not trust
you they're not going to continue
watching and you lose now one note on
this at the beginning of your journey
making content the reason why it takes
so long to grow initially is because you
don't have proof for credibility and so
a low fraction of people trust you long
enough to listen to your information
that's why it takes so long to get those
first thousand 2,000 5,000 subscribers
but as you get some trust as you grow
you start to build a following people
then trust the following and the cosign
is easier from people and then the
compounding continues this is why it
takes so long to grow at the beginning
because you don't have trust I actually
didn't start making YouTube videos until
I had half a million followers on
Instagram and Tik Tok and this was
strategic I didn't want to risk spending
$1,000 per YouTube video on editing and
thumbnails until I knew that I had at
least number three on that list of
credibility now I actually do have
almost a million followers I actually
have driven over a billion views I
actually have done the transformation
myself and I know the answer so it's
easy for you to trust me because I have
these things so I now have proof
figuring this out for myself I have big
social followings I've been where you
were because I used to not Plus I speak
directly to entrepreneurs and builders
that were like me so I have established
Common Ground I also spent a ton of time
and money building out this set so of
the list of six 2 3 4 5 six I have all
of them except the top one and now for
the top one I have an Academy of
entrepreneurs that I'm teaching the
methods to I'm also getting cold DMS of
people that are using my YouTube videos
to get traction on their own so very
soon I'll have the top one as well I
will have the full six and this is
really important to me because to me
everything I do is optimize to build
trust that's why I give the answers away
I want everyone to trust me because I
want to help people I genuinely do and
so that goes back and forth and it helps
build the trust immediately okay so
that's checkpoint two so to reorient us
the viewer has now accepted that a pain
point is there they want to solve and
they now trust you as a potential
vehicle that could solve it so what
comes next okay so checkpoint three is
plan of attack as soon as they feel like
the paino applies to them and they trust
you as someone that may solve it
immediately they want to know if you
have a plan for doing doing so if you
don't share a legit plan they will then
churn so there are two things you need
to do here in checkpoint 3 you need to
share that you have a plan and explain
why your plan is different than anything
else they've seen before the first one
is to create the point of difference
between your plan and everyone else's
now the easiest way to create the point
of difference is to create contrast
between what they've commonly seen and
what you believe your contrarian take
right so if they want to accomplish X
and everyone says to do y and you say to
do Z and you can convince them that Z is
better they will hold to see what Z is
the brain constantly is looking for
easier better faster ways to solve their
problem so if you create the problem and
they trust you as a solve for it and you
suggest something that may be different
than what they've seen before they are
going to be so curious that they will
wait to find out what it is this is
building that point of difference the
contrast the Curiosity Loop whatever you
call it that's how you do it now the
other psychology hack here once you
establish you have a point of difference
immediately they want to know what is
your plan now people like structure they
like order they like alignment structure
helps them remember things when they
remember things they feel smart when
they feel smart they associate feeling
smart with you as the person that makes
hem feel smart and they trust you more
so the best way to deliver the plan in
structure is a list these are my five
tips for doing X these are my 18
psychology hacks present your thoughts
in a structured list the brain is very
good at understanding numbers and
chunking things down into steps that's
how we learn everything as a kid if you
jump into your tactics in the video
without teeing it up as a list without
putting a structure around it people
will feel lost and confused if they're
lost and confused they turn so now for
the last time I'm going to pull up my
full Hook from this video one more time
and I'm going to show you how I walk
through creating the list and creating
the point of difference okay now I
actually embedded the point of
difference a little bit earlier like two
birds one stone I talked about this in
the paino section but this is the point
of difference so I said if you want to
grow on social media you need Psychology
but not psychology in a book you need to
understand how to implement psychology
to hack viewers brains to do and act how
you want there's kind of two points of
difference there there's growth you
think it's this I say psych ology
there's psychology you think it's book
learning I say it's actually
implementing in videos there's actually
two subconsciously there and I did it
earlier instead of later because I'm
trying to use the fewest amount of
sentences I figured it was two birds one
stone now the ordered Lis thing comes
later obviously this is me saying I have
18 psychology hacks I have a full
Playbook this is me presenting the plan
to you and then right after I finish the
hook I then reiterate that there are six
checkpoints and those checkpoints or
stage Gates I say it again because I
don't want 18 to feel overwhelming so I
say six again to break it down that's
how important it is to explain things
with structure and this all happened in
24 seconds across 12 sentences if you
can pull a viewer through these three
checkpoints as fast as possible they
will then be primed for the rest of the
video okay so at this point the viewer
has accepted there's a paino to solve
they trust you and they know you have a
plan to solve it so there's just one big
question left and this is one that
matters so so much do they want you to
be the one to solve it for them do they
like you this is likability the number
one psychological hack or checkpoint or
bucket to get people addicted to your
content is to make them like you enough
to want to watch it people disarm their
inhibitions when they genuinely like a
person I'm not just talking about
physical attraction do they like the
energy and brand that you bring forward
this is critical and as someone who's
typically monotone I have brought my
energy up to create this likeability or
at least I hope if you're watching this
I hope you like the way I'm presenting
this I have three psychological hacks to
improve your likeability if you're a
Creator now the first first one the
biggest one is energy people act like
mirrors if you give low energy they will
receive that and start giving low energy
back if you have high energy it's
infectious the easiest way to get people
to resonate with your content on a
psychological level is to bring your
energy of delivery up by like 50% and
the easiest way to do this this is what
I do is I record one line at a time it
sounds crazy but when you talk in
paragraphs you start to Trail off
towards the end of your sentences
reading six seven sentences off the top
of your your head you just lose energy
but if you record one line at a time yes
you have to chop it after but you can
deliver with high energy every single
line This is a super super easy hack to
up your energy now the second best way
to increase likability is simplification
again people like when they feel smart
if you make them feel dumb they will not
like you it's really that simple this
means using simple words and short
sentences so what I do is I repeat my
points twice if I say something with
technical jargon I'll repeat it a the
second time saying it again with simpler
terms and maybe using a metaphor that's
a little bit easier to understand and I
kind of just talk in this way normally I
think that's one of the superpowers of
my style but this simplification by
force is actually a really helpful way
to increase people's comprehension when
they can hear you and understand you
they like you more now the third best
way to become more likable is to
genuinely just be yourself and I know it
sounds so basic but people can detect
when you're playing a character I
legitimately wear this black hoodie
every single day this black hat every
day I talk like this I'm a Content nerd
I'm a business nerd you cannot fake this
energy around this stuff and because of
that you can sense that through the
camera and you like me more for it
whether you believe what I say or not
you like when people talk about things
they like that's how the brain works
they just perceive authenticity and this
is the big thing when you're likable
people root for you and they want to be
around you they want you to be the one
that solves their problems and as a
Creator when you're trying to identify a
problem a pain point that they pay
attention to and solve it this is all
you're after now if you're not likable
if you're kind of a grouch you can still
win but it's going to take so much
longer because your value and your
information has to be so good that it
overcomes the deficiency of your
personality it's much easier if people
just like you now the sooner someone
likes you the better and the easier it
will be to hold them so it's possible
they may already come into a video
having liked you from something else so
in that case checkpoint 4 is already
checked off but if this is the first
thing they're seeing of you they're
probably going to take 3 to 5 minutes
and make a call whether they like you or
not those three things I mentioned are
ways to improve your chances of someone
liking you more all right so checkpoint
five at this point the viewer has
understood the pain point they trust you
they understand you have a plan and they
like you but this is all preal this is
like the intro stage you were just
trying to get them to opt in to giving
you a chance to hear what you have to
say and now you can see why the hook in
your video is so important and why it
takes so much time to dial it in we've
deployed like 12 psychology tactics up
to this point just trying to get the
viewer primed to accept any kind of
message so the next question checkpoint
5 is can we get them to pay attention
long enough to hear what we have to say
it's crazy when you really think about
it right you spent all that time all
that effort all that energy trying to
get them to pay attention long enough to
potentially give you the chance to
deliver a message and still you have to
fight to hold their attention it's
pretty crazy but this is kind of the
most important checkpoint within the
body of the video is getting them to
continue to pay attention until the last
stage so of course have a few psychology
hacks for getting them to hold their
attention the first one is to create a
hunt people's brains work in Loops when
they open a loop they need to close it
that is why to-do lists are so nagging
you write something down on a to-do list
you fret until it's closed people work
in open and closed Loops so when you
need to keep someone interested for 20
or 30 minutes to watch a full video you
need to continually open Loops in their
brain the best way to do this is to lead
with the most valuable piece of
information first and then tease that
there are other things like it buried
throughout the video that first piece is
like a dopamine release and it validates
that it's worth staying then you create
this hunt these Loops that people have
to hunt to close to do this tactically
just continue reminding them about the
gold at the end I didn't really do it
well in this video but you can think
about when people talk about six tactics
and when they're on number two they say
and wait for the end because the last
one's going to be great right that is
them opening a long-term Loop while they
close these Min ones they want you to
stay to close that long-term Loop all
right hack number 14 is reh hooking in
previous videos I've talked a lot about
the importance of reh hooking throughout
your content because you do all that
work to lay the initial hook but then if
you don't rehook everything just
atrophies down to zero so you have to
keep reh hooking their interest and the
best way to do that is to keep
reigniting that paino solution Gap where
are they where do they want to be remind
them where are they where do they want
to be create contrast against where they
are where they want to be common belief
contrar in take continue to create that
contrast and you'll be able to rehook
them throughout now the best way to do
this is that and flip so saying things
like now that point was good but
honestly if you don't figure out this
point it's never going to work right
continuing to give that zigzag dance
that's how you rehook them all right
another way to keep them interested
throughout and I talk a lot about this
in my storytelling video which I'll link
here if you want to check out the during
the body storytelling a lot of these
techniques I broke down a lot deeper in
some other videos but a great way to do
this is what I call a trans Rhythm if
you create a desirable rhythm with the
Cadence of your words they will stay
because it's soothing to listen to I've
noticed that that the monotony that
comes with same length sentences
actually leads to boredom and then
people churn so the best way to do this
is to use your voice as an instrument
and try to deliver off balance
enunciation off-balance Cadence to
create this Rhythm keep them on their
toes some short sentences and then
deliver some long Legato sentences some
compound sentences some quick sentences
keep them off balance and it creates
this trans style Rhythm where they're
just locked into hearing it it's almost
like music in a way if you look down
your script and you don't see a jagged
line with the end of your sentences that
means all of your sentences are around
the same length and it creates that
monotonous plotting feeling you want
that Jagged line so look down your
script and make sure you have that all
right so now we've come to the last
checkpoint checkpoint six this is what
you're after the whole reason you do one
through five is to get people to
checkpoint 6 checkpoint 6 is getting the
viewer to take an action so far you've
established a paino built trust laid out
a plan got them to like you and
re-hooked them throughout the video so
that they could absorb most of your
value the last step can you get them to
take the action after all that's why
we're making content in the first place
we need viewers to take some action now
that action could be to subscribe it
could be to share it could be to sign up
for a free email list or a lead Magnet
or a community it also could be to
convert and transact for a paid product
right from the video the actions vary
but we need the viewer to take an action
if they don't it's not that the rep was
all for nothing but we don't really Clos
the process that we were trying to do
here now I've got three final psychology
hacks to trick the viewer into taking
the action the first one is called close
the loop at the end of the video tell
the viewer that you have successfully
closed the paino solution Gap and that
by doing this they should have
everything they need to be able to take
the information in the video and solve
for it themsel but if they would like to
increase the speed and get to the
solution faster then they can take your
action or purchase your product this
hack of reminding them that all the
information is there but if they want
speed they can pay for it is super
effective and it works because almost no
one can absorb 100% of the information
on the first go round but the whole
point of the video was to demonstrate
that you have the end to- endend
knowledge and 5% of people are going to
be able to take that watch it three
times and implement it thems God bless
them it's the other 95% that want to pay
for Speed now that they trust you
that'll take the action the hack is that
you reminded them that the loop is
closed because by reminding them it res
signals that pain point that they wanted
to solve they will feel like it's still
unsolved because they haven't absorbed
all the information and they will look
to take an action to solve it all right
my second hack for getting the viewer to
take the desired action is an unexpected
surise surprise most of Life boils down
to expectations verse reality if they
expected a highquality masterpiece in
your video but you fell short chances
are they're not going to take the action
but if the reality of watching the video
blew away their expectations especially
if it was because of how valuable the
information actually was they are way
more likely to take the action that you
suggested this is why I was able to grow
from 0 to 65,000 Subs on YouTube in like
two months I try to make all of my
videos at a 12 out of 10 quality that
blows people away so this the unexpected
surprise works every time all right and
the last psychology tip hack number 18
is the recap tell the viewer what you're
going to do do it and then remind them
at the end of what you did that
reminding is the recap this is the final
nail that closes the loop on that paino
solution Gap and that by doing that it
reminds them that they should take the
action if they haven't yet solved the
pain watch I'm going to show you an
example right here as I close this but
I'm only doing it as long as you take
the action look in the description all
right guys that's all I have for this
video those were 18 tricks to hack
viewer psychology to get more addicted
into your content if you like this video
and you want more breakdowns like this I
kind of like making these but I don't

should cover in the next video and
remember there is so much free stuff in
the description I'm giving it all away
