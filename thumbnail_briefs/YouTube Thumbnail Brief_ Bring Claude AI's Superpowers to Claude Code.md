**Visual Concept Suggestions:**

* Split screen: Claude AI web interface creating a PowerPoint → Claude Code terminal doing the same thing  
* File icons (PowerPoint, Excel, Word) flowing from Claude AI logo into terminal window  
* Your screen showing actual .pptx, .xlsx, .docx files being generated in Claude Code  
* Before: Plain text output in terminal → After: Real downloadable files  
* "CODE EXECUTION" badge stamped over Claude Code terminal  
* Side-by-side comparison: "What they think Claude Code can do" vs "What it can ACTUALLY do"

**Summary of the Video:** Claude AI's web interface has game-changing file creation capabilities that most developers don't realize they can replicate in Claude Code. In this tutorial, I'm revealing exactly how to bring Claude AI's code execution powers \- the ability to create real PowerPoint presentations, Excel spreadsheets with working formulas, and formatted Word documents \- directly into your Claude Code workflow. You'll learn how to set up the same sandboxed Python environment that powers Claude AI's file creation, implement the bash commands that generate actual downloadable files instead of just text output, and configure Claude Code to handle complex data transformations and visualizations. I demonstrate building a complete system that converts CSVs into professional PowerPoint decks, creates financial models with working Excel formulas, and generates formatted reports \- all from your terminal. This includes the exact prompts, configuration files, and workflow patterns that unlock these hidden capabilities. I'm showing you the specific combination of bash scripts, Python environments, and Claude Code configurations that replicate every single file creation feature from the web interface. This isn't about getting text suggestions for files, it's about Claude Code actually building production-ready documents you can open immediately in Microsoft Office or Google Workspace.
