Everyone knows about MCP by now, but here's what nobody talks about - 90% of people who know about it still aren't using it.
You've probably seen the demos, heard it's the future, maybe even tried to set it up once.
But then you hit the wall of "okay, but HOW do I actually use this in my real workflow?"
After helping dozens of companies implement MCP, I've seen the same pattern - people get stuck between knowing it exists and actually getting value from it.
The documentation shows you the what, but nobody shows you the when and how.
So today I'm walking through exactly when MCP makes sense for YOUR specific use case, three different ways to implement it depending on your technical level, and the exact servers you should start with.
By the end, you'll know whether to use one-click Docker implementations, build custom servers, or just use pre-built ones - and more importantly, which approach fits your actual needs.
