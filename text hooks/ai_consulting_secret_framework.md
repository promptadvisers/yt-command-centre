Most companies pay thousands of dollars for AI consulting to learn what I'm about to walk you through for free
After implementing AI at hundreds of companies, myself and my team have found very similar patterns across all of them
A lot of leaders think it's all about giving tools, access, API keys, and a bunch of YouTube tutorials
But that's exactly why 80-90% of AI adoptions fail
The real barriers are more psychological and organizational - things that tutorials will never fix
What we've learned is it's all about getting one person or one unit of a company using AI successfully
Once that happens, organic adoption spreads like wildfire
So in this video, I'm going to walk you through how to assess the different types of people in your department
How to deal with the bureaucratic and organizational barriers that always come up
And most importantly, how to actually turn your team into AI-powered superhumans
This is the exact framework my team at Prompt Advisers uses, whether it's a small startup or Fortune 500
And you'll get it without writing a six-figure check
