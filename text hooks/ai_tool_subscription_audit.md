You're probably paying for way too many AI tools right now.
Let me guess - you've got 15 different subscriptions, half of them you don't even use, and every week there's some new tool everyone's hyping up that you feel like you HAVE to try.
You're drowning trying to keep up with every single tool that launches.
And here's the worst part - you don't even have a framework to decide what's worth it.
So you end up in one of two camps: either you're hoarding AI tools like they're Pokemon cards, or you've gone completely on strike and refuse to adopt any of them.
Both approaches are costing you money and opportunities.
But in this video, I'm going to walk you through the exact mental model that I use to cut through the noise.
You'll learn how to assess whether a tool is worth your time, when you should test it, how to know if you should adopt it, and most importantly - when you should just build it yourself.
We'll go through a real case study, and by the end of this video, you'll know exactly what's worth your time, what's worth paying for, and what you should just build yourself.
