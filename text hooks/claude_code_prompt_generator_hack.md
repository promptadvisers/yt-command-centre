There's a dirty little secret in the AI space that prompt sellers don't want you to know:

You can generate better prompts than anything they're selling - for ANY model, ANY use case - with one simple hack using Claude Code.

I'm talking about creating prompts for:
- Latest image models (Nano Banana, GPT-4 Image)
- Video generators (Sora, Veo3)
- Voice agents (11 Labs, VAPI, Retel)
- Text models (Claude 4 Opus, GPT-5)

All from a SINGLE prompt that researches each model's best practices and generates exactly what you need.

While everyone else is commenting "banana" on LinkedIn posts to get their "exclusive prompt pack," you'll be generating unlimited, customized prompts tailored to your business in minutes.

No coding. No technical expertise. Just paste, command, and watch your prompt empire build itself.

If you're tired of generic prompts that don't work for your specific needs, this video will change everything.
