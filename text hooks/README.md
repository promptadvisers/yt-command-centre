# Text Hooks - The 6-Word Power Formula

This folder contains video script hooks organized by topic. Use this README to understand the framework behind effective hooks and generate new ones.

## The 6-Word Power Formula

Every powerful hook contains these elements (in order of importance):

### 1. Subject Clarity Word
WHO is doing the action?
- "I", "You", "We", "They", "This tool", "Claude"
- Establishes the actor immediately
- **Pro tip**: "I" creates personal connection, "You" creates direct relevance

### 2. Action Word
WHAT did they do? Use strong verbs.
- **Strong**: automated, replaced, discovered, built, quit, stopped, broke
- **Weak**: used, tried, learned, worked with
- The verb carries the energy of the hook

### 3. Objective/End State Word
WHAT was the shocking result?
- The more unexpected, the better
- "$50,000", "entire business", "in one day", "without code"
- This is where the hook gets its punch

### 4. Contrast Word
WHAT's the before/after or unexpected twist?
- Creates tension between expected and actual
- "but", "instead", "without", "even though", "and"
- Sets up the curiosity loop

### 5. Proof Word (optional)
WHY should I believe you?
- "again", "for the 3rd time", "every single day", "consistently"
- Implies you've done this repeatedly
- Builds credibility without stating it directly

### 6. Time Word (optional)
WHEN/HOW FAST did it happen?
- "in 48 hours", "in 5 minutes", "overnight", "this week"
- Compresses achievement into believable timeframe
- Creates urgency and feasibility

## The Formula in Action

**Formula**: Subject + Action + Objective + Contrast + (Proof) + (Time)

### AI/Automation Examples

| Hook | Formula Breakdown |
|------|-------------------|
| "I automated my entire business in 48 hours" | Subject (I) + Action (automated) + Objective (entire business) + Time (48 hours) |
| "This AI tool replaced my $5k/month assistant" | Subject (This AI tool) + Action (replaced) + Objective ($5k/month assistant) |
| "Why I stopped using ChatGPT - and what I use instead" | Subject (I) + Action (stopped) + Objective (using ChatGPT) + Contrast (what I use instead) |
| "I built a $10k/month business with no code - again" | Subject (I) + Action (built) + Objective ($10k/month business) + Contrast (no code) + Proof (again) |

## Pattern Interrupt Hooks

These work by contradicting what the viewer expects:

| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Contrarian** | "Stop [common action]" | "Stop learning n8n in 2025" |
| **Warning** | "[Thing] is [scary adjective]" | "This AI feature is terrifying" |
| **Confession** | "I was wrong about [thing]" | "I was wrong about Claude" |
| **Challenge** | "You're [doing something] wrong" | "You're using AI wrong" |

## Hook Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Burying the hook**
   - Bad: "Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel, today we're going to talk about..."
   - Good: "I automated my entire business in 48 hours"

2. **Being vague**
   - Bad: "I found something interesting"
   - Good: "I found a Claude feature that changes everything"

3. **No curiosity loop**
   - Bad: "Here's how to use Claude Code" (no question in viewer's mind)
   - Good: "Why I stopped using ChatGPT" (viewer asks: what do you use instead?)

4. **Too long to get to the point**
   - First 5 seconds are critical
   - Get to the hook IMMEDIATELY

---

## AI/Automation Power Words

Use these to punch up your hooks:

### Action Words
- automated, replaced, built, discovered, quit, stopped, broke, killed, transformed

### Result Words
- entire, complete, $X,XXX, 10X, everything, all, massive

### Contrast Words
- but, instead, without, even though, and yet, despite

### Time Words
- instantly, in minutes, overnight, in 48 hours, this week, today

### Credibility Words
- again, consistently, every time, 3rd time, battle-tested

## Analyzing Existing Hooks

Here's how to analyze a hook from this folder using the formula:

### Example: claude_code_mini_course.md

**Hook**: "If you've been hearing all the hype around Claude Code and still aren't sure why you should care, even if you're not technical - this mini course is for you"

**Analysis**:
- **Subject**: You (implied - "you've been hearing")
- **Contrast**: "all the hype" vs "still aren't sure"
- **Qualifier**: "even if you're not technical" (addresses objection)
- **Objective**: "this mini course is for you" (value proposition)

**Formula Score**: Uses Contrast + Objection Handling + Value Promise. Missing strong Action verb.

**Improvement**: "I'll show you why non-technical people are going crazy over Claude Code - and how to use it in 15 minutes"
- Stronger action (show)
- Clearer time constraint (15 minutes)
- Maintains non-technical qualifier

## Template for New Hooks

Fill in this template when writing new hooks:

```
[SUBJECT: I/You/This tool] + [STRONG ACTION VERB] + [SHOCKING RESULT] + [CONTRAST/TWIST] + [OPTIONAL: TIME FRAME]
```

### Quick Generation Process

1. **Start with the result**: What's the most impressive outcome?
2. **Add the action**: What did you/the tool DO to get there?
3. **Add contrast**: What makes this unexpected?
4. **Add time** (if impressive): How fast did it happen?
5. **Test the curiosity loop**: Does this create a question the video answers?
