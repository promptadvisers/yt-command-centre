People are still manually typing out instructions for their custom GPTs and Claude projects, spending hours crafting the perfect prompt and knowledge base.

I have a productivity super hack that uses Claude Code to build tens of production-ready GPTs or projects with perfect instructions and researched knowledge bases - all from a single prompt.

While you're typing instructions line by line, I'm using a method that researches your business or use case, writes comprehensive instructions, and creates knowledge base files automatically.

This isn't another prompt engineering tutorial.

This is about turning Claude Code (or any editor of your choice) into your personal GPT or project factory that builds better assistants than 99% of what's out there.

By the end of this video, you'll know how to build an entire library of specialized assistants faster than it takes most people to write a single prompt.

Let's dive in.
