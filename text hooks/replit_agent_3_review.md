Replit Agent 3 is here and honestly, some of the updates are genuinely helpful

If you're someone who finds Claude Code too intimidating but ChatGPT too basic for real apps

This sits right in the middle where you probably want to be

The agent can now run for hours instead of minutes, which means you can actually let it build something substantial

But the part I actually care about - it tests its own work now

So when it builds your app, it's clicking buttons and checking if things actually work before calling it done

I spent 75 minutes with it yesterday and I want to show you exactly what that experience looks like
