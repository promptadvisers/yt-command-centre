Take a look at this n8n workflow.

Tens of nodes. Tons of AI agents all orchestrating together. Vector databases, memory management, parallel processing.

This looks like the future of automation, right?

Wrong – in reality, something like this wouldn’t just be expensive but risky to run in production

From hallucinations, to using the wrong tools, and ballooning API costs

Most people are living in La La Land when it comes to AI agents.

They see these complex orchestrations and think more agents equals better automation.

In this video, I'm going to show you why adding more agents doesn't make your system smarter - it makes it exponentially more likely to fail.
