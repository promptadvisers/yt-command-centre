What if I told you that you could vibe code your own AI agent builder platform?

One where you own the entire infrastructure, connect it to different tools and API requests, and don't have to wait on a feature release from another company to build it for you.

While everyone's going bonkers over these closed-source platforms, I just built my own visual automation platform using Replit Agent. It can chain different agents together and **automatically store the execution logs in a Google Sheet, all thanks to their new Connectors.**

In this video, I'm going to walk you through how I did this, how you can do it, and how to use their new Connectors feature to integrate with your tools and make this whole process as easy as possible.
