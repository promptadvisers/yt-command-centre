You're probably wasting hours in ChatGPT, running the same manual loop.

You start one chat to find your facts... then another, copy-pasting those facts into the new chat.

And then you spend the next few minutes iterating, giving it feedback and trying to nudge it in the right direction.

There must be a better way, right?

Absolutely. There is a way to build an **AI assembly line of agents** that does this entire process for you in **one shot**. It doesn't involve any code, and you just need to use natural language.

In this video, I'm going to show you exactly how to do this in Claude Code.

If you **watch till the end**, you'll be able to put together your own **mini-AI workforce** that can help you become **10X more productive**.
