If you're tired of Claude forgetting everything between conversations while ChatGPT remembers your preferences, this video is for you.

Claude just quietly added the ability to reference past chats - and nobody's talking about how to actually use it to build your own memory system.

I'm showing you how to turn this hidden feature into something even more powerful than ChatGPT's memory database, and you can set it up in minutes.

I'll start with the basic setup that instantly makes Claude remember your context, then show you advanced techniques that make it feel like you've been working with the same assistant for months.

The only thing standing between you and having Claude actually remember who you are is knowing these simple commands exist.

If that sounds useful, stick with me till the end.

Let's dive in.
