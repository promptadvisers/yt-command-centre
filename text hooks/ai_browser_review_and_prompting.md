AI browsers are having their "iPhone moment" right now, and each one of them is claiming to revolutionize how we browse

But while everyone's arguing about which one's "best," they're missing the bigger question: are ANY of them actually worth it?

I tested these browsers across multiple real work scenarios to see if they're any good

And even if you decide they ARE worth using, no one's teaching you how to actually prompt them properly - because AI browser prompting is different from using ChatGPT

So today I'm showing you real demos of four major browsers, but more importantly, I'm giving you the exact prompt templates that actually unlock their potential - templates you can copy and modify for your own use

By the end, you'll know three things: whether AI browsers are worth your time at all, which one fits your specific needs if they are, and the prompting frameworks that separate the people getting value from those just burning money on subscriptions
