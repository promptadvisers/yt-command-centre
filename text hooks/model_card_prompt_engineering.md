Every couple of weeks, we get a brand new AI model. And every single time, I watch people panic.

They scramble through tutorials, join Discord servers asking "what changed?", and waste hours trying random prompt tweaks hoping something sticks.

Meanwhile, the answer is always sitting right in front of you in a document that everyone ignores and creators barely mention.

They barely mention it to make sure you stay dependent on them to pre-digest information and spoon-feed it to you.

These documents are called model cards. Every AI company publishes them, but nobody teaches you how to read them.

In this video, I'm gonna show you a 10-minute hack that I use every single time - one prompt that turns any model card into your personal prompt engineering consultant.

No more guessing. No more broken prompts. No more starting from scratch.

If you watch this video till the end, you'll never be overwhelmed or confused by a model update again.

Let's get into it.
