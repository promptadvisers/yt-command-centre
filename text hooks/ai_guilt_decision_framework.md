I recently came across this clip between Shaan Puri and Alex Hormozi, and this soundbite really made me think

[Play soundbite: "Yeah, I have this like overwhelming sense of AI guilt... I think Elon has AI guilt"]

I realized a lot of others - maybe you - might be suffering from the same thing

That feeling that you're not using AI enough, or you're using it wrong, or you're somehow falling behind

After working with hundreds of businesses on AI implementation, I've seen this pattern everywhere

So in this video, I'm going to walk through how you can get rid of AI guilt

And give you a simple framework to cut through all the noise and answer the only question that matters - should you even be using AI in the first place?
