> Create a plan to create an MCP server out of the pinecone docs I attached @pinecone-docs.md
  that will let me use three commands (Remember This, Show Me My Memories, and Recall My
  Memory) that will \
  \
  1) store the memory in the pinecone vector database and embed it with additional metadata
  to help AI remember the memory -- it will also store all the vector ids associated with the
  memories stored so its easy to retrieve later\
  2) show all vectors (using the vector IDs to retrieve the associated texts) when I say Show
  Me My Memories\
  3) and when I say Recall My Memory, it will try to find a memory that's contextually
  related to what I'm trying to accomplish - for example, if I say Recall My Memory and say
  something related to UI, it would look for any memories related to colour or design
