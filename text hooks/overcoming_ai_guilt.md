I recently came across this clip between Shaan Puri and Alex Hormozi, and this soundbite really made me think

[Play soundbite: "Yeah, I have this like overwhelming sense of AI guilt... I think Elon has AI guilt"]

I realized a lot of others - maybe you - might be suffering from the same thing

That feeling that you're not using AI enough, or you're using it wrong, or you're somehow falling behind

After working with hundreds of businesses on AI implementation, I've seen this pattern everywhere

So in this video, I'm going to walk through how you can get rid of AI guilt

And more importantly, how to actually figure out what AI tools make sense for you - if any

Because here's the thing: the AI landscape is chaos right now, and without a mental model to organize it, you'll always feel lost

Let me show you the framework I use to make sense of all this
