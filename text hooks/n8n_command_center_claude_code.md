If you want to build your own n8n command center where you can plan, build, and repair workflows with your personal AI copilot, this video is for you.

I'm showing you how to set one up using Claude Code hosted in Cursor, and even if you're not technical, you'll be able to replicate this in minutes.

I'll start with the beginner-friendly setup that just works, then show you the advanced techniques that make this genuinely fun to use.

The only thing standing between you and mastering n8n is having a workspace that can answer your questions, alleviate your concerns, and help you decide what's actually worth building.

If that sounds interesting, stick with me till the end.

Let's jump in.
