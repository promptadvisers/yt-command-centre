If you're watching this video, you probably have an AI learning addiction.

And this video is your intervention.

If you're suffering from this, you probably have 20 tabs open right now - half-watched tutorials, AI newsletters you'll barely read, and that Google Sheet where you track tools you swear you'll learn someday.

You're not falling behind because you don't know enough. You're falling behind because you're learning instead of doing.

So close those tabs. Cancel that course you've barely started.

Because in the next few minutes, I'm going to walk you through mental models that cut through the noise and tell you exactly what's worth learning, what's worth ignoring, and how to finally get off the learning hamster wheel.

Let's break your addiction.
