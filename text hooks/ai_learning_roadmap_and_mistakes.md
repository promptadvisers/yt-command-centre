"Learning AI in today's age is one of the hardest things to do. There are distractions everywhere. By the time you think you've mastered something - you grasp something - it becomes seemingly obsolete.

And the issue is when you keep bouncing around, or you don't start because either you have people around you who are still in the stone age - the proverbial stone age - or you live in an area where jurisdictions or regulations make it hard for AI, it becomes a limiter.

And the one thing I know is it's better for everyone to be able to upskill and be literate in this stuff.

In this video, my goal is NOT to give you a list of shoulds. I don't believe that there should be a 'should' in this space. Tool names will change every day. Frameworks will change every day. Models will change every day.

So what I hope to convey in this video is what you COULD do.

I'm going to go through the four biggest mistakes you could make, and then I'll give you the top 10 questions that are the most common questions I've gotten from thousands of hours of consulting and hundreds of questions in my community that I think apply to a lot of people.

Last thing is I will give you the simplest roadmap, and even that roadmap is not going to be cemented. It's very big picture, and the goal is - people want me to tell them what to do, and I think it's important to know for yourself what you should do, and only you can be the determiner of that.
